        "content": "By Cisco Talos \nTHURSDAY, MARCH 30, 2023 18:29 \nTHREAT ADVISORY \nCisco Talos is tracking and actively responding to a supply chain attack involving the 3CX Desktop Softphone application. \nThis is a multi-stage attack that involves sideloading DLLs, seven-day sleep routines, and additional payloads dependent on a now-removed GitHub repository for Windows-based systems.   \nMacOS systems used a different infection chain leveraging a hardcoded C2 domain, as opposed to the GitHub repo.   \nThis is just the latest supply chain attack threatening users, after the SolarWinds incident in 2020 and the REvil ransomware group exploiting Kaseya VSA in 2021.

        "title": "Summary ",
        "content": "Cisco Talos recently became aware of a supply chain attack affecting Windows and MacOS users of the 3CX software-based phone application. This attack leveraged the legitimate update functionality of the 3CX application to deliver a set of malicious payloads to 3CX users. \nThe infection chain consists of several stages and involves sideloading DLLs along with a sevenday sleep cycle before the malware attempts to retrieve additional malicious artifacts from a now-removed GitHub repository for the Windows based infection. The GitHub repository hosted a series of icon files with encrypted data appended to the end of the files. These encrypted strings, once decrypted, contained the C2 domains for additional malicious artifacts. \nThe MacOS version used a hard coded C2 domain. These second-stage payloads are information stealers that attempt to obtain system information and the latest browsing history records, indicating this information may be used as a filtering mechanism to identify and discard some victims while maintaining unauthorized access to others. \nDuring our investigation we were able to see file activity dating back to February 3, 2023. However, the GitHub repository has been active since December 2022. The full scope of the attack is uncertain at this point. The 3CX website claims to have over 600,000 customers and 12 million daily users. It's unclear how many are users of the 3CX Desktop App versus the web app option that was not affected. 3CX is currently asking users to use the web app while they work to release an update. "

        "content": "Based on Cisco Talos investigation, it appears the infrastructure that supported this attack was being prepared as early as February 2022 when the domains were first registered. A second cluster of activity happened toward the end of 2022 when the GitHub repository was created, along with a few other domains. The sbmsa[.]wiki domain was also created on Feb. 9, 2023, which was found to be used by the second stage of the MacOS version. \nThe timeline below illustrates these clusters of activity. \nCisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware detailed in this post.
