  Understanding the threat landscape for Kubernetes and containerized assets 
  By Microsoft Threat Intelligence 
  The dynamic nature of containers can make it challenging for security teams to detect runtime anomalies or pinpoint the source of a security incident, presenting an opportunity for attackers to stay undetected. Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed threat actors taking advantage of unsecured workload identities to gain access to resources, including containerized environments. Microsoft data showed that in the past year, $51\%$ of workload identities were completely inactive, representing a potential attack vector for threat actors. 
  Microsoft released and updated the threat matrix for Kubernetes, an active knowledge base for security threats that target Kubernetes clusters, to systematically map the attack surface of Kubernetes. We also worked with MITRE to develop the ATT&CK $\textcircled{8}$ for Containers matrix in 2021. As the adoption of 
  Understanding the threat landscape for Kubernetes and containerized assets | Microsoft Security Blog containers-as-a-service among organizations rises, Microsoft Threat Intelligence continues to monitor the unique security threats that affect containerized environments. 


【Threats in Kubernetes environments 】
==============================
  Containerized assets (including Kubernetes clusters, Kubernetes nodes, Kubernetes workloads, container registries, container images, and more) are at risk of several different types of attacks. To fully secure containerized workloads, organizations must secure the containers and the code running within them, software dependencies and libraries, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, runtime, and more. 
  Threats in Kubernetes environments can come from six primary areas: 
  Compromised accounts: In cases where Kubernetes clusters are deployed in public clouds (such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)), compromised cloud credentials could lead to cluster takeover, as attackers who have access to account credentials can get access to the cluster’s management layer.   
  Vulnerable or misconfigured images: Images that are not updated regularly might contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited in malicious attacks.   
  Environment misconfigurations: An attacker with access to the Kubernetes API, either through exposed management interfaces or lack of appropriate authentication/authorization controls, could completely take down the server, deploy malicious containers, or hijack the entire cluster.   
  App-level attacks: Applications could be exploited through several typical methods, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and remote file inclusion.   
  Node-level attacks: Attackers can gain initial access through nodes (host machines that containers run on) that run on vulnerable code or software, have open management interfaces such as ${\mathsf{S S H}},$ , or run commands from the cloud control plane. There is also the risk of pod escape, where a compromised pod can provide access to the node or to other pods in the cluster.   
  Unauthorized traffic: Insecure networking between the different containers within the cluster and between the pods and outside world could be subject to malicious traffic if not secured. 


【Case study: Password spray attack leads to containers being used for cryptomining 】
==============================
  In the past year, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed AzureChecker threats (tracked as Storm-1977) launching password spray attacks against cloud tenants in the education sector. The attack involves the use of AzureChecker.exe, a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that is being used by a wide range of threat actors. 
  We observed that AzureChecker.exe connected to sac-auth[.]nodefunction[.]vip to download AES-encrypted data that when decrypted reveals the list of password spray targets. The tool then also accepted the file accounts.txt, which contained the username and password combinations to be used for the attack, as input. The threat actor then used the information from both files and posted the credentials to the target tenants for validation. 
  Microsoft Threat Intelligence was able to observe an instance of successful account compromise and found that the threat actor leveraged a guest account to create a resource group within the compromised subscription. The threat actor then created more than 200 containers within the resource group and used them for cryptomining activity. 


【Securing containerized environments 】
==============================
  The following best practices can help secure containerized assets against commonly observed threats. 


【Secure code prior to deployment 】
==============================
  Ensuring that containers have secure code prior to deployment is essential to preventing issues during deployment and runtime. To facilitate this, Microsoft Defender for Cloud scans container images for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations and alerts customers of issues before a container is deployed 
  Defender for Cloud DevOps also provides visibility into the security posture of the CI/CD platform. Additional best practices such as restricting access to DevOps tooling, using a secret store instead of hard-coding secrets in code or documentation, and using hardened DevOps workstations to build and deploy code can help prevent security issues before code is deployed. 


【Secure container deployment and runtime 】
==============================
  Container deployment refers to the phase of the lifecycle where container images are pulled from the static container registry to be run on virtual machines hosts. During deployment, you should ensure the following best security practices: 
  Ensure containers are immutable: Prevent patches from running containers whenever possible. As best practice, if you notice that a running container needs updates, you should rebuild the image and deploy the new container. Introducing new code in running containers can introduce new vulnerabilities, bypass secure development lifecycle protections, as well as pose an operational risk in case a container is restarted and run again with the original container image content without any runtime modifications. Leverage Admission Controllers: Configure policies to prevent containers from being deployed from untrusted registries, from running out of alignment with the minimal Pod Security Standard that fits the pod requirement (such as restricting root privileges), and from utilizing too many resources in the event of a denial-of-service attack. These can be enforced with Azure Policy Add-On for Kubernetes. Gate deployments of vulnerable images: Ensure that the containers being deployed are free of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations by running a vulnerability scan in the Build and Ship phases. Any image with high or critical severity vulnerabilities should be blocked from deployment. 
  Container runtime refers to the phase of the lifecycle where containers are running on the virtual hosts. During runtime, monitor your running containers for any new vulnerabilities that might have been introduced during runtime. In cases where a container image was not scanned in build time or in registry before being deployed to the cluster, Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management supports Azure vulnerability assessments. 
  Additionally, monitor each node, pod, and container during runtime for any sort of anomalous or malicious activity that may be occurring: 
  Look for malicious API calls and unusual activity using a monitoring system to identify any unusual Kubernetes API server requests for malicious activity. Defenders can query Kubernetes API calls in Defender XDR advanced hunting using the CloudAuditEvents table. For AKS clusters, Container Insights offers the ability to collect Syslog events from Linux nodes, to then be accessed within Azure’s built-in workbooks. 
  Defender for Containers’ Agentless discovery for Kubernetes provides API-based discovery of Kubernetes clusters, their configurations, and deployments. Defender for Cloud also identifies runtime threats at both the API level and the workload level. Additionally, organizations can use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to identify and remediate attack paths to address any potential attack vectors. 


【Secure user accounts and permissions 】
==============================
  Attackers are increasingly using compromised identities for initial access and for establishing long-term persistence within an environment. If a compromised user has access to Kubernetes services, an attacker could use that identity to access those services using portal access or the command-line interface. In cases where Kubernetes clusters are deployed in public clouds (such as AKS in Azure or GKE in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)), compromised cloud credentials could lead to cluster takeover as attackers who have access to account credentials can get access to the cluster’s management layer. 
  The following recommendations, focused on requiring strong authentication to services and following the principle of least privilege, can help secure cloud credentials from compromise: 
  Use strong authentication when exposing sensitive interfaces to the internet. For example, attacks were observed against exposed Kubeflow and Argo workloads that were not configured to use OpenID Connect or other authentication methods.   
  Use strong authentication methods to the Kubernetes API to help prevent attackers from gaining access to the cluster even if valid credentials such as kubeconfig were achieved. For example, in AKS use Entra ID authentication instead of basic authentication. By using Entra ID authentication, a short-lived credential of the cluster is retrieved after authenticating to Entra ID.   
  Avoid using the read-only endpoint of Kubelet in port 10255, which doesn’t require authentication. In newer versions of managed clusters, this port is disabled.   
  Implement multifactor authentication (MFA).   
  Configure the Kubernetes role-based access controls (RBAC) for each user and service accounts to have only necessary permissions. This applies also to other external authorization providers such as Azure RBAC in AKS.   
  In a managed cluster, Kubernetes credentials are often retrieved or generated by the cloud provider through API call. To reduce the attack surface, grant permissions to the cloud provider API only to necessary accounts. In the case of Azure, make sure that only required identities have permissions to call: /subscriptions/resourceGroups/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedC lusters/listClusterUserCredential   
  The kubeconfig file can contain credentials of accounts that allow interaction with a cluster. By applying the least privilege principle to all accounts, you can limit the impact of an account compromised through the kubeconfig file. To further limit misuse of the kubeconfig file, enable Microsoft Entra-based authentication to AKS and disable the local admin account, avoiding the use of the kubeconfig file altogether. 
  The Kubernetes project also lists the following recommendations for permissions and role assignment best practices: 
  Avoid wildcard permissions, especially to all resources.   
  Use RoleBinding instead of ClusterAdminBinding to give access within a namespace.   
  Avoid adding users to the system:master group as it bypasses RBAC.   
  Use impersonation rights for admins instead of adding to the cluster admin role. Audit and monitor when impersonation is being done. Avoid granting the escalate or bind permissions to roles when not needed, audit and monitor when escalation is being made.   
  Avoid adding users to the system:unauthenticated group.   
  Limit permissions to issue certificate signing requests (CSR) and certificates.   
  Avoid granting users with create rights on service accounts/token, which could be exploited to create TokenRequests and issue tokens for existing service accounts.   
  Users with control over validatingwebhookconfigurations or mutatingwebhookconfigurations can control webhooks that can read any object admitted to the cluster, and in the case of mutating webhooks, also mutate admitted objects 


【Secure container images 】
==============================
  Secure the CI/CD environment. Secure code repositories and CI/CD environment by placing gates to restrict unauthorized access and modification of content. This can include enforcing RBAC permissions to access and make changes to code, artifacts and build pipelines, ensure governed process for pull-request approval, apply branch policies and others. Apply image assurance policy to evaluate container images against vulnerabilities, malware, exposed secrets or other policies. By ensuring consistent and comprehensive image assurance policy across the build, ship, and run development stages. One approach of ensuring images pass assurance or compliance checks it to sign the container images, so the image signature can be checked downstream when deploying to Kubernetes clusters at runtime. Take and store data backups from pod-mounted volumes for critical workloads. Ensure backup and storage systems are hardened and kept separate from the Kubernetes environment to prevent compromise. 


【Restrict network traffic 】
==============================
  The Kubernetes API server is the gateway to the cluster. Restricting access to the API server, as well as restricting how pods can communicate, can prevent unwanted access to the clusters management, even if an adversary gained valid credentials to the cluster. The following best practices can help harden clusters against attacks. 
  Restrict access to the API server using intrusion detection signatures, network policies, and a web application firewall to block traffic at network boundaries to pods and services in a Kubernetes cluster. In managed clusters, cloud providers often support native built-in firewalls, which can restrict the IP addresses that are allowed to access the API server. Implement a Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) such as Azure Firewall, which offers a solution for AKS to monitor inbound and outbound traffic. You can integrate Azure Firewall as well as several third-party firewalls into Azure Sentinel to accumulate all logs into a centralized location. AKS also supports Retina, a cloud-agnostic platform for analysis of Kubernetes’ workload traffic. Use Kubernetes network policies to control traffic and manage how pods communicate. Adapt a network intrusion prevention solution to a Kubernetes environment if needed, in order to route network traffic destined to services through the security solution. In some cases, this can be done by deploying a containerized version of a network intrusion prevention solution to the Kubernetes cluster and be part of the cluster network, 
  Understanding the threat landscape for Kubernetes and containerized assets | Microsoft Security Blog and in some cases, routing ingress traffic to Kubernetes services through an external appliance, requiring that all ingress traffic only come from such an appliance. 
  Enable Just In Time (JIT) access to the API server through Microsoft Entra conditional access. Employing JIT elevated access to the Kubernetes API server helps reduce the attack surface by allowing access only at specific times, and through a governed escalation process. Enabling JIT access in Kubernetes is often done together with OpenID authentication, which includes processes and tools to manage JIT access. One example of such OpenID authentication is Azure Active Directory authentication to Kubernetes clusters. The JIT approval is performed in the cloud control plane level. Therefore, even if attackers have access to account credentials, their access to the cluster is limited.   
  Limit access to services over network. Avoid exposing sensitive interfaces insecurely to the internet or limit access to it. Sensitive interfaces include management tools and applications that allow the creation of new containers in the cluster. Some of those services do not use authentication by default and are not intended to be exposed. Examples of services that were exploited include Weave Scope, Apache NiFi, and more. If services need to be exposed to the internet and are exposed using a LoadBalancer service, use IP restriction (loadBalancerSourceRanges) when possible. This reduces the attack surface of the application and can prevent attackers from being able to reach the sensitive interfaces.
