  The certificate shows the serial number — 61b0feca645af9296aa422d2c289e1d13593dbb6 — and fingerprint — 134a3d105eef24fab27ed0fb3729e271306bde6dc4e9d2a4a5c5d1c82b0390fe we discovered five hosts containing the same certificate: 
  149[.]28[.]54[.]212 
  95[.]179[.]246[.]73 
  149[.]28[.]36[.]160 
  45[.]76[.]68[.]112 
  3[.]86[.]255[.]88 
  Our analysis revealed that the backdoors communicated over HTTPS to the server 149[.]28[.]54[.]212 and the Alchimist user interface was accessible via ports 8443 and 50423 from servers 149[.]28[.]54[.]212, 95[.]179[.]246[.]73, and 149[.]28[.]36[.]160. 
  The rise of all-inclusive C2 frameworks 
  Our discovery of Alchimist is yet another indication that threat actors are rapidly adopting off-theshelf C2 frameworks to carry out their operations. A similar ready-to-go C2 framework called "Manjusaka'' was recently disclosed by Talos. Alchimist also comprises a single-file based, readyto-go C2 tool along with its remote access tool Insekt, implemented in GoLang and compiled to target Windows and Linux machines. 
  The functionality of Manjusaka and Alchimist's web interfaces exhibiting remote administration capabilities, performed through the RATs, signifies the plethora of functionalities packed into these C2 frameworks. A threat actor gaining privileged shell access on a victim's machine is like having a Swiss Army knife, enabling the execution of arbitrary commands or shellcodes in the victim's environment, resulting in significant effects on the target organization. 
  Endpoint security teams should implement layered security defense, be constantly vigilant in monitoring the privileged operations in their environments and detect any unauthorized programs attempting to gain root privileges. Network security teams should be looking for any unusual traffic to their organizations' environment and be cautious about suspicious artifacts downloaded to their network. Having controlled download and file execution policies on the endpoints and servers can effectively protect organizational assets from threats. 
  Organizations and users who are using the vulnerable versions of polkits pkexec utilities should patch their systems following the mitigation steps as advised by RedHat. For the users of Unixlike systems other than Linux, who cannot find patches for their operating systems, a workaround could be implemented by removing the SUID-bit of pkexec utility.
