A similar ready-to-go C2 framework called \"Manjusaka'' was recently disclosed by Talos. Alchimist also comprises a single-file based, readyto-go C2 tool along with its remote access tool Insekt, implemented in GoLang and compiled to target Windows and Linux machines. \nThe functionality of Manjusaka and Alchimist's web interfaces exhibiting remote administration capabilities, performed through the RATs, signifies the plethora of functionalities packed into these C2 frameworks. A threat actor gaining privileged shell access on a victim's machine is like having a Swiss Army knife, enabling the execution of arbitrary commands or shellcodes in the victim's environment, resulting in significant effects on the target organization. \nEndpoint security teams should implement layered security defense, be constantly vigilant in monitoring the privileged operations in their environments and detect any unauthorized programs attempting to gain root privileges. Network security teams should be looking for any unusual traffic to their organizations' environment and be cautious about suspicious artifacts downloaded to their network. Having controlled download and file execution policies on the endpoints and servers can effectively protect organizational assets from threats. \nOrganizations and users who are using the vulnerable versions of polkits pkexec utilities should patch their systems following the mitigation steps as advised by RedHat. For the users of Unixlike systems other than Linux, who cannot find patches for their operating systems, a workaround could be implemented by removing the SUID-bit of pkexec utility. \nCoverage \nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below. \nCisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware detailed in this post.
