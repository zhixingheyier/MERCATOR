【Initial Access】
==============================
  The particular point of interest in this campaign is the effectiveness of the TTP’s at bypassing many security tools. In the delivery stage the campaign uses compromised email accounts to inject into previous conversations by adding a link and imploring the recipient to check the latest update to the ongoing conversation.
  The link provided is to a Google Drive account, a trusted entity to users, and often not capable of being blocked in many enterprises. The Google Drive link downloads a password protected zip file with a javascript (JS) file inside.


【Execution】
==============================
  Upon execution, the JS file will be executed by wscript. Wscript then gives way to Regsrv32 which loads a txt file into memory. The txt file however is actually a DLL file that once loaded into memory runs under the regsrv32 process.
  The use of these infection methods were able to bypass several security layers including Windows Defender at the time of run but we witnessed it detect the txt DLL and eat the file on disk while missing the running executable running in memory.
  While several infections witnessed during the campaign never moved past beaconing to the Ursnif C2 at 8.208.90.28 with the DLL in memory, some samples proceeded further.


【Persistence】
==============================
  For those samples the following behavior occurred.
  In the registry location seen referenced below, there could be found more modules for the malware to call upon.


【Command and Control】
==============================
  Initial C2 picked up on the following alerts:
  With the TorClient Registry Binary being confirm for its namesake after some time:
