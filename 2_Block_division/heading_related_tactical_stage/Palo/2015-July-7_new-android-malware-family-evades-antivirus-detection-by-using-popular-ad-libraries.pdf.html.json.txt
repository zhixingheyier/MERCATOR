==============================
  Thus far, Palo Alto Networks has observed 49 unique samples of the Gunpoder family. We have found three different groups of variants within this family. By comparing samples of the various Gunpoder variants, we were able to make many observations about the evolution of Gunpoder.
  Specifically, variants of group 1 (12 samples) can propagate via SMS and entice users to make a payments. Variants of group 2 (16 samples) can only entice users to make a payment, and variants of group 3 (21 samples) do not contain SMS propagation or entice users to make payments. Group 3 was discovered to be the newest of the Gunpoder malware variants.
  Furthermore, the same certificate signed the first and second variants, while a different certificate signed the third variant. While the certificate varies between these groupings of variants, we highly suspect that the same malware author wrote all of these samples. A number of constant variables remain consistent between all three variants, such as the following that was identified in “Constants.java.”

  For a list of hashes of the three Gunpoder variants, please refer to the Appendix.
  We observed that several samples mentioned above could be downloaded from two third-party app stores:http://www.aptoide.com/andhttp://www.mgccw.com.
  Users will have a large bill, if they are tricked. The fake payment costs users only about $0.49 or $0.29, but the bill caused by sending SMS is much more than this. The total amount of the SMS bill depends on how many contacts reside in users’ devices.
