【Lateral movement 】
==============================
  After acquiring the login credentials, the actor started to move laterally from workstations to server hosts. Typical lateral movement methods were employed, using Windows commands. First, a network connection with a remote host was established using the command “net use”. 
  net use \[IP address入IPC\$ “[password] /u:"[user name]" $>\$8$ temp\\~tmp5936t.tmp 2>&1″ 
  Next, the actor copied malware to the remote host using the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC). 
  exe /node:[IP address] /user:”[user name]” /password:”[password]” PROCESS CALL CREATE “cmd.exe /c \$appdata\Adobe\adobe.bat“   
  exe /node:[IP address] /user:”[user name]” /password:”[password]” PROCESS CALL CREATE “cmd /c sc queryex helpsvc $>$ \$temp\tmp001.dat“ 


【Exfiltration 】
==============================
  We observed that the malware operator attempted to create SSH tunnels to a remote server located in South Korea from several compromised server hosts. They used a custom tunneling tool to achieve this. The tool receives four parameters: client IP address, client port, server IP address and server port. The tool offers basic functionality, forwarding client traffic to the server. In order to create a covert channel, the malware encrypts forwarded traffic using trivial binary encryption.
