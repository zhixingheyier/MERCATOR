        "content": "Despite the network worm’s self-replicating feature, the attackers did some manual lateral movement before starting on the destructive malware. We believe this was done to look for a better spot to release the worm. They seemed to be moving through the network via Psexec and stolen credentials, opening a default meterpreter port (TCP 4444) and downloading and running a backdoor (meterpreter). The attackers also checked the network configuration, potentially searching for servers attached to multiple networks or VPN links in order to penetrate adjacent networks that could be linked to the Olympic Committee infrastructure. \nOne of the hosts in the network of the affected ski resort hotel had Kaspersky Lab’s system watcher component enabled, which collected quite a few of the artifacts used by the attackers for lateral movement. According to the telemetry from this host, the attackers entered the system on 6 February, 2018. They used three types of PowerShell scriptlets: TCP 4444 port opener, ipconfig launcher and a downloader. \nBased on telemetry we received from one of the hosts, we built a timeline of the attackers’ activity and a histogram showing when the attackers started executables on the system. \nFrom this we can see that the attackers were mostly busy outside of office hours according to Korean Standard Time $\\mathrm{(UTC+}9\\mathrm{)}$ , perhaps to attract less attention or simply due to their own timezone.
