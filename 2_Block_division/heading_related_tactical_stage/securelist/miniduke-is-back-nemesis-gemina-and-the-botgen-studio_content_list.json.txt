【Persistence 】
==============================
  Miniduke/CosmicDuke is capable of starting via Windows Task Scheduler, via a customized service binary that spawns a new process set in the special registry key, or is launched when the user is away and the screensaver is activated. 


【Reconnaissance 】
==============================
  The malware can steal a variety of information, including files based on extensions and file name keywords: 
  \*.exe;\*.ndb;\*.mp3;\*.avi;\*.rar;\*.docx;\*.url;\*.xlsx;\*.pptx;\*.ppsx;\*.pst;\*.ost;\*psw\*;\*pass\*; \*login\*;\*admin\*;\*sifr\*;\*sifer\*;\*vpn;\*.jpg;\*.txt;\*.lnk; \*.dll;\*.tmp;\*.obj;\*.ocx;\*.js 
  Note: we believe the “\*sifr\*” and “\*sifer\*” keywords above refer to the transliteration of the English word “Cypher” in some languages. 
  Also, the backdoor has many other capabilities including: 
  Keylogger   
  Skype password stealer   
  General network information harvester   
  Screen grabber (grabs images every 5 minutes)   
  Clipboard grabber (grabs clipboard contents every 30 seconds)   
  Microsoft Outlook, Windows Address Book stealer   
  Google Chrome password stealer   
  Google Talk password stealer   
  Opera password stealer   
  TheBat! password stealer   
  Firefox, Thunderbird password stealer   
  Drives/location/locale/installed software harvester   
  WiFi network/adapter information harvester   
  LSA secrets harvester   
  Protected Storage secrets harvester   
  Certificate/private keys exporter   
  URL History harvester 
  InteliForms secrets harvester 
  IE Autocomplete, Outlook Express secrets harvester and more… 


【Exfiltration 】
==============================
  The malware implements several methods to exfiltrate information, including uploading data via FTP and three variants of HTTP-based communication mechanisms. A number of different HTTP connectors act as helpers, trying various methods in case one of them is restricted by local security policies or security software. These three methods are: 
  Direct TCP connection and HTTP session via Winsock library HTTP session via Urlmon.dll HTTP session via invisible instance of Internet Explorer as OLE object
