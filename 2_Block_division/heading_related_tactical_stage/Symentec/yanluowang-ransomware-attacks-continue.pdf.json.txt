【Lateral movement】
==============================
  In most cases, PowerShell is used to download tools to compromised systems including BazarLoader to assist in reconnaissance. The attackers then enable RDP via registry to enable remote access. After gaining initial access, the attackers usually deploy ConnectWise (formerly known as ScreenConnect), a legitimate remote access tool.
  In order to perform lateral movement and identify systems of interest, such as the victim’s Active Directory server, the attackers deploy Adfind, a free tool that can be used to query Active Directory, and SoftPerfect Network Scanner (netscan.exe), a publicly available tool used for discovery of hostnames and network services.
  The next phase of the attack is credential theft and the attackers use a wide range of credential-stealing tools, including:
  GrabFF: A tool that can dump passwords from Firefox
  GrabChrome: A tool that can dump passwords from Chrome
  BrowserPassView: A tool that can dump passwords from Internet Explorer and a number of other browsers
  Along with these tools, the attackers also use a number of open-source tools such as KeeThief, a PowerShell script to copy the master key from KeePass. In some cases, customized versions of open-source credential-dumping tools were also observed (secretsdump.exe). Credentials were also dumped from the registry.
  In addition, the attackers have also used a number of other data capture tools, including a screen capture tool and a file exfiltration tool (filegrab.exe). Cobalt Strike Beacon was also deployed against at least one targeted organization.
  Other tools used include ProxifierPE, which can be used to proxy connections back to attacker-controlled infrastructure, and the free, Chromium-based Cent web browser.
