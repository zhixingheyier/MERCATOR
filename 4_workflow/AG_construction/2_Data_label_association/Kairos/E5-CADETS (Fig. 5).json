The HTTP request carrying a payload executes shell code, establishing a connection to a C&C server (4.21.51.250). The attacker obtains username and hostname information before unexpectedly losing control. The next day, the attacker sends the malformed HTTP POST again and continues the attack from the C&C server (128.55.12.233). The attacker exfiltrates the host’s environment information such as hostname, passwd, and username, in the subsequent attack.",
