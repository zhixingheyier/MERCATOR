The PID of the process was obtained viatasklist /svcand the dump was performed usingcomsvcs.dll, which is a known living-off-the-land binary (LOLBIN). Note that it is likely that the attackers executedquser.exeto see whether other users or admins were also logged in, meaning privileged accesses were present in LSASS. According toMicrosoft documentation, to use this command the attacker must have Full Control permission or special access permission.\nThey also saved the registry hivessam.hiveandsystem.hive, which can both contain secrets or credentials.\nFinally, they tried to dump the LSASS process again, using aforloop iterating over the output fromtasklist.exe.

APT10 was the first group known to have access to this backdoor but Operation FishMedley indicates that it may now be shared among multiple China-aligned APT groups.\nSodaMaster can only be found decrypted in memory and that's where we detected it. Even though we did not recover the full loading chain, we have identified a few samples that are the first step of the chain.\nWe found six different malicious DLLs that are abusing legitimate executables viaDLL side-loading. They all implement the same decryption and injection routine.\nFirst, the loader reads a hardcoded file, for exampledebug.png, and XOR decrypts it using a hardcoded 239-byte key. Table 5 summarizes the different loaders. Note that the XOR key is also different in each sample, but too long to be included in the table. Also note that we did not recover any of these encrypted payloads.\nTable 5.

It reads the Firefox SQLite database and runs the querySELECT encryptedUsername, encryptedPassword, hostname,httpRealm FROM moz_logins. \nThe last three loaders persist as a service namedNetlock,MsKeyboardFiltersrv, anddownmap, respectively.\nAs mentioned above, the SodaMaster payload was publicly analyzed by Kaspersky and the samples we've found don't seem to have evolved much. They still implement the same four backdoor commands (d,f,l, ands) that were present in 2021.\nTable 6 shows the configurations from the four different SodaMaster payloads that we identified.
