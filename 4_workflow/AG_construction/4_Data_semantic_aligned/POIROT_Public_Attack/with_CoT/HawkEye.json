HawkEye dynamically extracts two PE files into its memory, which are then copied into the two newly created child processes of \"vbc.exe\". It also modifies its ThreadContext data (It calls the API, SetThreadContext) and makes its entry point to the transfered PE file. When \"vbc.exe\" resumes running it can be executed. It's a trick that malware often performs to camouflage itself behind of a normal process. \nThe two \"vbc.exe\" processes collect credentials from the victim's system. One is used to collect the credentials of browsers. The other one focuses on email clients and IM clients to steal credentials and profiles. Both PE files injected into \"vbc.exe\" have the same code framework. They first call a function to collect credentials and save them in memory, and second, it reads the collected data, formats it, and saves it to a tmp file from its command line parameter. \nFigure 5 shows HawkEye calling the CreateProcess API to start one of the two \"vbc.exe\" processes, with the parameter shown below in the \"Locals\" sub-tab. You can see the full path of \"vbc.exe\". \"/stext \"\"C:\\Users\\\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpBE3D.tmp\"\"\" is the parameter passed to it. The tmp file name is random and different from the two \"vbc.exe\" processes, which temporarily saves collected credentials. \nThe two PE files are not packer protected and not .Net written program.   \nThe first \"vbs.exe\" collects credentials from victim's browsers and the system credential manager for IE. In my analysis, this variant of HawkEye focuses on the following browsers: \nMicrosoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Opera, Mozilla Sunbird, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Portable Thunderbird, Mozilla SeaMonkey, YandexBrowser, Vivaldi browser, and more. \nFigure 6 shows some strings defined in the ASM code of the browsers that the HawkEye malware wants to collect credentials from. \nThe collected credentials are then saved into the tmp file from its command line parameter. HawkEye_RegAsm keeps checking this tmp file, and once the credentials are collected, it is done. HawkEye_RegAsm then reads the entire data of this tmp file into its memory and the deletes it immediately. \nThe second PE file in \"vbc.exe\"collects profile and credential information of the email and IM software client installed on a victim's machine. \nThe clients it targets are: \nQualcomm Eudora, Mozilla Thunderbird, MS Office Outlook, IncrediMail, Groupmail, MSNMessenger, Yahoo!Pager/Yahoo!Messenger and Windows Mail. \nBelow is an example list that HawkEye stole from the Chrome browser on my test machine. As you can see, it includes login URL, Browser name, User name, Password, Created time, and the full path of the file where the collected information came from. \nThe second PE file in \"vbc.exe\" not only collects the client's login username and password, but also profile information, such as the recipent Server address, recipient Server Port, protocol Type (POP3), SMTP Server, SMTP Port, etc. Figure 7 shows a screenshot of Ollydbg when \"vbc.exe\" was about to write the collected recipient Server addresses into its tmp file. It writes one line once. The same tmp file is finally read by HawkEye_RegAsm and then deleted. \nOn my test machine, I only installed MS Outlook with one account.
