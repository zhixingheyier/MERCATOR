Based on ESET telemetry, we believe PowHeartBeat replaced CLRLoad in more recent Worok campaigns as the tool used to launch PNGLoad.\nThe first layer of the backdoor code consists of multiple chunks of base64-encoded PowerShell code. Once the payload is reconstructed, it is executed viaIEX. Once decoded, another layer of obfuscated code is executed, which we can see in Figure 3.\nThe second layer of the backdoor first base64 decodes the next layer of its code, which is then decrypted withTriple DES(CBC mode). After decryption, this code is decompressed using thegzipalgorithm, thus giving the third layer of PowerShell code, which is the actual backdoor. It is divided into two main parts: configuration, and handling backdoor commands.\nThe main layer of backdoor code is also written in PowerShell and uses HTTP or ICMP to communicate with the C&C server.

While we don't see any code in PowHeartBeat that directly loads PNGLoad, the backdoor has the capabilities to download and execute additional payloads from the C&C server, which is likely how the attackers have deployed PNGLoad on systems compromised with PowHeartBeat. PNGLoad is a loader that uses bytes from PNG files to create a payload to execute. It is a 64-bit .NET executable – obfuscated with.NET Reactor– that masquerades as legitimate software. For example, Figure 11 shows the CLR headers of a sample masquerading as a WinRAR DLL.\nOnce deobfuscated, only one class is present. In this class, there is aMainPathattribute containing the directory path the backdoor searches, including its subdirectories, for files with a.pngextension, as shown in Figure 12.\nEach.pngfile located by this search ofMainPathis then checked for steganographically embedded content. First, the least-significant bit of each pixel's R (red), G (green), B (blue), and A (alpha) values are fetched and assembled into a buffer. Should the first eight bytes of that buffer match the magic number seen in Figure 13 and the next eight-byte value, control, be non-null, the file passes PNGLoad's steganographic content check. For such files, processing continues with the remainder of the buffer decrypted with a multiple-byte XOR, using the key stored in PNGLoad'sSecretKeyBytesattribute, and then the decrypted buffer is gzip-decompressed. The result is expected to be a PowerShell script, which is run immediately.\nInterestingly, operations performed by PNGLoad are logged in a file whose path is stored in the variableLogFilePath. Operations are only logged if a file is present whose path is specified by the internal variableIfLogFilePath.\nWe have not been able to obtain a sample.pngfile used along with PNGLoad, but the way PNGLoad operates suggests that it should work with valid PNG files. To hide the malicious payload, Worok uses Bitmap objects in C#, which only take pixel information from files, not the file metadata. This means that Worok can hide its malicious payloads in valid, innocuous-looking PNG images and thus hide in plain sight.",
