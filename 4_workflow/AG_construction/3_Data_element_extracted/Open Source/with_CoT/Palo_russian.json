In this campaign, the Russian language malspam is addressed to Russian email recipients, often with email addresses ending in.ru. These emails have file attachments. These file attachments are archived Windows executable files disguised as a PDF document. In September 2018, the attachments were zip archives. In October 2018, the attachments were zip archives, 7-zip archives, and rar archives. In November 2018, the attachments were rar archives. And in December 2018, the attachments changed to gzip archives with file names ending in.gz.\nFigure 1: Flow chart for infections from Redaman banking malware from September through December of 2018.",

This indicates Redaman checks if it is running in a sandbox or similar type of analysis environment.\nIf no exceptions occur, the Windows executable drops a DLL file in the user'sAppData\\Local\\Temp\\directory, creates a randomly-named folder underC:\\ProgramData\\directory and moves the DLL under that folder as a random file name. This Redaman DLL is made persistent through a scheduled Windows task with the following properties:\nName: Windows Update \nDescription: Updating Windows components. \nTriggers: Executed whenever the user logs on \nAction:rundll32.exe \"C:\\ProgramData\\%random value%\\%random value.random 3-character extension%\",DllGetClassObject host\nAfter creating a scheduled task and causing the DLL to load, the initial Redaman executable file deletes itself.\nFigure 7: Example of a Redaman DLL persistent through a scheduled task.\nFigure 8: Process Hacker showing the Redaman DLL active using rundll32.exe.\nRedaman uses an application-defined hook procedure to monitor browser activity, specifically Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. It then searches the local host for information related to the financial sector. Other capabilities of Redaman include:\nDownloading files to the infected host \nKeylogging activity \nCapture screen shots and record video of the Windows desktop \nCollecting and exfiltrating financial data, specifically targeting Russian banks \nSmart card monitoring \nShutting down the infected host \nAltering DNS configuration through the Windows host file \nRetrieving clipboard data \nTerminating running processes \nAdding certificates to the Windows store",
