This could indicate that the attackers did preparatory work in advance (they may have obtained the information in earlier attacks on the same organization or its employees, or on other organizations or individuals associated with the victim organization). \nMicrosoft Word documents attached to the phishing emails contained malicious code that exploits the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. The vulnerability enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code (in the attacks analyzed, the main module of the PortDoor malware) without any additional user activity. \nAn earlier series of attacks in which the PortDoor malware was also used was described by Cybereason experts. A new version of PortDoor was identified in the course of our research. ",
