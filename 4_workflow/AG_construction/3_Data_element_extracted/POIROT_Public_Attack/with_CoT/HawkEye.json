        "content": "Once HawkEye started, it spawned a suspended child process, \"RegAsm.exe\", from the Microsoft .Net framework installation directory – which is a tool for Assembly Registration. Meanwhile, HawkEye extracted a PE file into its memory and then moved the PE file into \"RegAsm.exe\". The dynamically extracted PE file is the main program of HawkEye. It's called \"HawkEye_RegAsm,\" to differentiate these files in the analysis. HawkEye_RegAsm began running after resuming running \"RegAsm.exe\" after being suspended. \nHawkEye_RegAsm is a .Net written program, which is packed by ConfuserEx v1.0.0 to protect itself. This creates a big challenge for analysts to read its code and analyze it. The code was actually totally obfuscated, as shown in figure 3. \nAfter sleeping 10 seconds, HawkEye_RegAsm starts its work on the victim's system. Through analysis so far, it appears to mainly perform the following functions: \n1> Set up clipboard logger   \n2> Set up keyboard logger   \n3> Spawn another two child processes \"vbc.exe\", both from the .Net framework directory as well. $4>$ Send collected data to an email address using SMTP from time to time (every 10 minues). \nHawkEye_RegAsm starts a thread to perform the above tasks, and then every 10 minutes it sends its collected information to its Yandex email address. \nHawkEye_RegAsm sets up a clipboard and keyboard logger using Windows-native APIs (such as SetWindowsHookEx, SetClipboardViewer, etc.) Its local functions can record victim's behaviors when the victim types on the keyboard as well as when copying data into the system clipboard. \nFigure 4 shows an example of the information that HawkEye_RegAsm collected from its keyboard and clipboard logger, as well as the software title from when the event occurred.

        "content": "HawkEye_RegAsm performs a similar task as to the RegAsm.exe. It spawns two suspended child processes, \"vbc.exe\", which are from the same directory as RegAsm.exe. HawkEye dynamically extracts two PE files into its memory, which are then copied into the two newly created child processes of \"vbc.exe\". It also modifies its ThreadContext data (It calls the API, SetThreadContext) and makes its entry point to the transfered PE file. When \"vbc.exe\" resumes running it can be executed. It's a trick that malware often performs to camouflage itself behind of a normal process. \nThe two \"vbc.exe\" processes collect credentials from the victim's system. One is used to collect the credentials of browsers. The other one focuses on email clients and IM clients to steal credentials and profiles. Both PE files injected into \"vbc.exe\" have the same code framework. They first call a function to collect credentials and save them in memory, and second, it reads the collected data, formats it, and saves it to a tmp file from its command line parameter. \nFigure 5 shows HawkEye calling the CreateProcess API to start one of the two \"vbc.exe\" processes, with the parameter shown below in the \"Locals\" sub-tab. You can see the full path of \"vbc.exe\". \"/stext \"\"C:\\Users\\\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpBE3D.tmp\"\"\" is the parameter passed to it. The tmp file name is random and different from the two \"vbc.exe\" processes, which temporarily saves collected credentials. \nThe two PE files are not packer protected and not .Net written program.   \nThe first \"vbs.exe\" collects credentials from victim's browsers and the system credential manager for IE. In my analysis, this variant of HawkEye focuses on the following browsers: \nMicrosoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Opera, Mozilla Sunbird, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Portable Thunderbird, Mozilla SeaMonkey, YandexBrowser, Vivaldi browser, and more. \nFigure 6 shows some strings defined in the ASM code of the browsers that the HawkEye malware wants to collect credentials from. \nThe collected credentials are then saved into the tmp file from its command line parameter. HawkEye_RegAsm keeps checking this tmp file, and once the credentials are collected, it is done. HawkEye_RegAsm then reads the entire data of this tmp file into its memory and the deletes it immediately. \nThe second PE file in \"vbc.exe\"collects profile and credential information of the email and IM software client installed on a victim's machine. \nThe clients it targets are: \nQualcomm Eudora, Mozilla Thunderbird, MS Office Outlook, IncrediMail, Groupmail, MSNMessenger, Yahoo!Pager/Yahoo!Messenger and Windows Mail. \nBelow is an example list that HawkEye stole from the Chrome browser on my test machine. As you can see, it includes login URL, Browser name, User name, Password, Created time, and the full path of the file where the collected information came from. \nThe second PE file in \"vbc.exe\" not only collects the client's login username and password, but also profile information, such as the recipent Server address, recipient Server Port, protocol Type (POP3), SMTP Server, SMTP Port, etc. Figure 7 shows a screenshot of Ollydbg when \"vbc.exe\" was about to write the collected recipient Server addresses into its tmp file. It writes one line once. The same tmp file is finally read by HawkEye_RegAsm and then deleted. \nOn my test machine, I only installed MS Outlook with one account. My test account and server profile were collected and put in the structure shown below, which would normally be sent to the attacker's email box.",
