We explained that a link exists between Uroburos and the Agent.BTZ malware, which was responsible for \"the most significant breach of U.S. military computers ever.\" [1] Nine months later, after the buzz around Uroburos, aka Snake or Turla, we now identified a new generation of Agent.BTZ We dubbed it ComRAT and, by now, analyzed two versions of the threat (v3.25 and v3.26). \nAs reported earlier this year, Agent.BTZ used the same encoding key and the installation log file name as Uroburos. ComRAT, in its version 3.25, shows the same behavior. Furthermore, the attackers also shared a C&C domain. The latest version of ComRAT known to us (v3.26) uses a new key and does not create the installation log file, in order to complicate the analysis and to disguise the link between the two cases. \nAnother very interesting fact: the attackers use COM Object hijacking, the same persistence mechanism as COMpfun, which we described recently. \nTaken everything into consideration, the indications we saw during our analyzes lead to the supposition that the group behind Agent.BTZ and Uroburos is still active and is pursuing the Agent.BTZ path once more to improve and change the RAT.

        "content": "In version 3.26, the author changed the key and remove the known file name This action can be an indication for the developer's effort to hide this connection   \nThe main difference is the design Agent.BTZ is a common RAT, a simple library executed on an infected machine. ComRAT is more complex and cleverer. The malware is loaded into each and every process of the infected machine and the main part (payload) of the malware is only executed in explorer.exe. Furthermore, the C&C communication blends into the usual browser traffic and the malware communicates to the browser by named pipe. It is by far a more complex userland design than Agent.BTZ. \nThese differences, mainly the more complex design, lead us to give this malware a new name. \nThe analyzed dropper of v3.25 has a compilation date of February 6th 2014. The more recent dropper of v3.26, which has all the mentioned changes implemented, reveals a compilation date of January 3rd 2013. We suspect that this date is spoofed in order to disguise that this is in fact a newer version. "

        "title": "Conclusion",
        "content": "This analysis shows that even after the Uroburos publication in February 2014, the group behind this piece of malware seems to be still active. In any case, the ComRAT developers implemented new mechanisms, changed keys, removed log files to hide their activities and tried to disguise the connections between the RAT ComRAT, the rootkit Uroburos and the RAT Agent.BTZ as much as possible. However, we can still follow the evolution of the malware by comparing the versions. \nThe persistence mechanism discovered in October 2014 makes it possible to intrude into a system in a really discreet manner and we estimate that other actors will use the same persistence mechanism in the near future. \nWe will definitely keep our ears and eyes open and continue analyzing.
