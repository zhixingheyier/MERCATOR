        "content": "Redaman is banking malware first noted in 2015 that targets recipients who conduct transactions using Russian financial institutions. First reported as theRTM banking Trojan, vendors likeSymantecandMicrosoftdescribed an updated version of this malware as Redaman in 2017. We have found versions of Redaman in Russian language mass-distribution campaigns during the last four months of 2018. This blog tracks recent developments from an ongoing campaign of malicious spam (malspam) currently distributing this banking malware from September through December of 2018. We cover the following areas:\nInfection vector \nEmail characteristics \nTargeted recipients \nAnalysis of a Redaman sample \nInfection traffic"

        "title": "Infection vector",
        "content": "Since September of 2018, Redaman banking malware has been distributed through malspam. In this campaign, the Russian language malspam is addressed to Russian email recipients, often with email addresses ending in.ru. These emails have file attachments. These file attachments are archived Windows executable files disguised as a PDF document. In September 2018, the attachments were zip archives. In October 2018, the attachments were zip archives, 7-zip archives, and rar archives. In November 2018, the attachments were rar archives. And in December 2018, the attachments changed to gzip archives with file names ending in.gz.\nFigure 1: Flow chart for infections from Redaman banking malware from September through December of 2018."

        "content": "Subject lines, message text, and attachment names constantly change for this malspam. But the messages all have a common theme: they refer to a document or file for an alleged financial issue the recipient needs to resolve. These messages are often vague, and they contain few details on the alleged financial issue. Their only goal is to trick the recipient into opening the attached archive and double-clicking the executable contained within.\nAmong dozens of examples seen from September through December of 2018, here is a selection of 10 subject lines from this malspam:\nSubject: Акт сверки сентябрь-октябрь \nSubject: Весь пакет док-ов за прошлый месяц \nSubject: Все док-ты за август-сентябрь \nSubject: Деб.задолженность среда \nSubject: Документы, сверка 02.10 \nSubject: Заявка на возврат за ноябрь \nSubject: Необходимо свериться среда \nSubject: Отправка на за прошлую неделю \nSubject: Пакет документов для оплаты 1е октября \nSubject: Сверка на оплату\nThe following are Google translations for the above subject lines:\nSubject: Act of reconciliation September-October \nSubject: All package of last month's documents \nSubject: All docs for August-September \nSubject: Debt due Wednesday \nSubject: Documents Verification for October 2018 \nSubject: Application for return for November \nSubject: Check the environment \nSubject: Sending on last week \nSubject: The package of documents for payment 1st October \nSubject: Payment Verification\nFigure 2: Example of Redaman malspam from September 2018.\nFigure 3: Example of Redaman malspam from October 2018.\nFigure 4: Example of Redaman malspam from November 2018.\nFigure 5: Example of Redaman malspam from December 2018."

This indicates Redaman checks if it is running in a sandbox or similar type of analysis environment.\nIf no exceptions occur, the Windows executable drops a DLL file in the user'sAppData\\Local\\Temp\\directory, creates a randomly-named folder underC:\\ProgramData\\directory and moves the DLL under that folder as a random file name. This Redaman DLL is made persistent through a scheduled Windows task with the following properties:\nName: Windows Update \nDescription: Updating Windows components. \nTriggers: Executed whenever the user logs on \nAction:rundll32.exe \"C:\\ProgramData\\%random value%\\%random value.random 3-character extension%\",DllGetClassObject host\nAfter creating a scheduled task and causing the DLL to load, the initial Redaman executable file deletes itself.\nFigure 7: Example of a Redaman DLL persistent through a scheduled task.\nFigure 8: Process Hacker showing the Redaman DLL active using rundll32.exe.\nRedaman uses an application-defined hook procedure to monitor browser activity, specifically Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. It then searches the local host for information related to the financial sector. Other capabilities of Redaman include:\nDownloading files to the infected host \nKeylogging activity \nCapture screen shots and record video of the Windows desktop \nCollecting and exfiltrating financial data, specifically targeting Russian banks \nSmart card monitoring \nShutting down the infected host \nAltering DNS configuration through the Windows host file \nRetrieving clipboard data \nTerminating running processes \nAdding certificates to the Windows store"
