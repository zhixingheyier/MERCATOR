That configuration determines, among other things, the file extension for encrypted files, filenames, list of file extensions of files to encrypt, and the ransom message.\nThe vast majority of Scarab builds we have encountered drop and execute an embedded Delphi-written ClipBanker that monitors the clipboard content and replaces any string resembling a cryptocurrency wallet with an attacker-controlled one, specifically one of the following:\n`1HtkNb73kvUTz4KcHzztasbZVonWTYRfVx\n`qprva3agrhx87rmmp5wtn805jp7lmncycu3gttmuxe\n`0x7116dd46e5a6c661c47a6c68acd5391a4c6ba525\n`XxDSKuWSBsWFxdJcge8xokrtzz8joCkUHF\n`4BrL51JCc9NGQ71kWhnYoDRffsDZy7m1HUU7MRU4nUMXAHNFBEJhkTZV9HdaL4gfuNBxLPc3BeMkLGaPbF5vWtANQnt2yEaJRD7Km8Pnph\n`t1RKhXcyj8Uiku95SpzZmMCfTiKo4iHHmnD\nWe were able to conclusively link Spacecolon with at least two Scarab builds utilizing.flycryptand.restoreserverextensions for encrypted files – CosmicBeetle attempted to execute these builds on machines that had been compromised by Spacecolon shortly beforehand. Both builds follow the same file-naming patterns – the ransomware runs as%APPDATA%\\osk.exe and the embedded ClipBanker as %APPDATA%\\winupas.exe. This naming holds special importance for Spacecolon, as ScHackTool expects two such named processes to be running. Supposing this naming pattern is closely tied to Spacecolon, more than 50% of Scarab configurations shown by ESET telemetry may be related to Spacecolon.

This function supports one IOCTL (Input/Output Control) code (0x22C004), which can be used to trigger registration of an asynchronous procedure call routine responsible for processing intercepted keystrokes. \nInterception of keystrokes is done by setting up CompletionRoutineforIRP_MJ_READrequests for the keyboard driver object\\Device\\KeyboardClass0.\nWhen done, any process can start logging intercepted keystrokes by defining its own routine and passing it to the created device object using the custom IOCTL0x22C004.\nBy default, the driver tries to load two base payloads –WinSys.dll and Client.dll–which have the ability to download and execute additional payloads. The first one,WinSys.dll, is anMPRESS-packed DLL embedded in the driver's binary in an encrypted form.

One thing that makes this slightly different is there isn't any information regarding enabling macros or content and only has a print button on the document. As you can see if a user clicks the print button a fake error pop up is triggered. In the background Trickbot is being downloaded and executed on the system, compromising it. \nThis is yet another example of how we see commodity malware taking advantage of whatever current event is top of mind for their potential victims. By keeping the lures fresh the adversaries can continue to successfully deliver their malware payloads to unsuspecting victims. \nThere are a couple of hunting avenues an organization could take to find these types of emails. First would be searching the subject lines looking for keywords. Additionally, you can search the bodies of emails for the same keywords to widen the search. In this instance, either option would have returned this result. Finally, searching for attachment names for the target keywords is paramount. Casting a wide net around potential hunting locations will likely net you the best results. As you can see in this example, searching on the subject and body would have had a positive result, but searching on filename alone would have missed the attempt. ",

Once the payload signature is corrected, NSIS decompilers such as7zip (9.34 – 15.05)are able to extract the malicious NSIS script.\nThis customization provides defenders with a detection opportunity as outlined within the hereafter-provided YARA rules.\nDuring initialization, MBR Killer visually hides itself by moving off-screen.\nOnce hidden, the malicious installer verifies whether it is being emulated by temporarily patching the native Windows ZwClose function (part of ntdll.dll) to immediately succeed with STATUS_SUCCESS before closing a dummy handle through kernel32::CloseHandle(0x12345678) and validating that, although the handle was invalid, the CloseHandle method succeeded.\nIf the anti-analysis check succeeds, the script issues the HideWindow NSIS call, whichhides the installerand proceeds to validate the existence of the first physical drive \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE0 by opening it.\nOnce the first \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE0 drive opened, MBR Killer conditionally attempts to wipe:\nMFT (Master File Table) contains metadata about files and directories, such as names, dates and sizes. \nVBR (Volume Boot Record) contains, amongst others, code required to bootstrap the operating system. \nEBR (Extended Boot Record) contains information to describe logical partitions.\nMBR Killer then proceeds to wipe the MBR (Master Boot Record) three times by writing 512 empty bytes at offset 0 and attempts to repeat the wiping on the next available disk (\\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE1, \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE2, ...).\nOnce the MBR Killer wiper has done its damage, the script attempts to modify its process privileges to enable the SeShutdownPrivilege and initiates a reboot.\nTo initiate the reboot, MBR Killer calls ExitWindowsEx with:\nEWX_REBOOT (0x2) to cause a reboot \nEWX_FORCE (0x4) to try to force the operation \nSHTDN_REASON_MAJOR_SOFTWARE (0x00030000) to indicate it was software-caused \nSHTDN_REASON_MINOR_UPGRADE (0x00000003) to indicate the software reason is an upgrade.\nWorth noting is that even-though the MBR Killer script attempts a reboot, the same functionality is implemented within the NSIS installer itself. Upon reboot, the affected machines were rendered inoperable.\nWhile the wiper we observed was not packed using VM-Protect, the decompiled script is near-similar to the2016 Banco de Chile wiper componentand indicates the source-code was likely shared.\nSupporting this theory was the change in NSIS version from v3.0b2 (Released on August 4th, 2015) to v3.04 (Released on December 15th, 2018) alongside the removal of the MBR Killer branding.\nWhile the 2016 sample wasbzip2-compressed, the recompiled version now uses the more performantzlibcompression.\nFunctionality-wise, our newly observed wiper performs a justified reboot (0x2, EWX_REBOOT) whereas the Banco de Chile variant merely performed an unjustified shut-down (0x8, EWX_POWEROFF).\nAs a hunting opportunity, we observed NSIS executables (legitimate or not) automatically drop the %Temp%\\ns[a-zA-Z0-9]{5}.tmp\\System.dll library as part of thelegitimate NSIS System plugin, giving developers the ability to call any exported function from any DLL. While not indicative of malicious activity, we recommend threat hunters review the creation of the above library to identify potentially undesirable installers within their environment.",

Most no longer showed the responsible process, but at least one host had an active connection from an injected svchost.exe process to FlawedGrace command and control visible.\nDuring the first day of the intrusion, we observed a network signature hit for RDP tunneling from one of the FlawedGrace command and control servers, but due to no follow-up activity, it would appear that this did not function properly for the threat actors.\nThis likely also explains the removal of the local user account that had been added to the Remote Desktop Users group.\nCobalt Strike\nCobalt Strike, unlike the other two malware families observed, remained in constant communication with its command and control server after the first beacon was loaded until the end of the intrusion.\nWhile the Cobalt Strike command and control stayed active over the intrusion the threat actors did selectively deploy and remove it on hosts with only the beachhead host maintaining beaconing activity for the whole duration.\nCobalt Strike beacon configuration:",

The Disttrack we analyzed contained the internal domain names and administrator credentials associated with the targeted organization. The internal domain and credentials appear to be stolen prior to the creation of this tool, as it is not a public domain and the credentials are not weak enough to have obtained through guessing, brute force or dictionary attacks.\nDisttrack uses the internal domain names and credentials to log into remote systems on the same network segment. The malware determines the local network segment associated with the target system (call to gethostname) by obtaining the IP address for the system (call to gethostbyname). It then uses the system's IP addresses to enumerate the /24 network (x.x.x.0-255) that the system is networked with, and will attempt to spread to each of these remote systems.\nThe dropper then attempts to open the service manager on each remote system to start the RemoteRegistry service, which it will connect to using RegConnectRegistryW. Once connected, the dropper attempts to disable UAC (User Access Control) remote restrictions by setting the following registry key to a value of \"1\":\nSOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\\LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy\nAfter disabling UAC, the dropper connects to the remote system (using NetUseAdd) and logs in using the embedded stolen credentials. The dropper then checks to see if it has administrator privileges on the remote system by attempting to open \"\\system32\\csrss.exe\", which allows it to determine if it can write its payload to the \"\\system32\" folder on the remote system. The dropper then has two different methods in which it can pivot to the remote system.\nThe first method involves the dropper writing itself to \"\\system32\\ntssrvr32.exe\" on the remote system. After writing itself to the remote system, the dropper creates a service named \"ntssrv\", with a display name of \"Microsoft Network Realtime Inspection Service\" and a description of \"Helps guard against time change attempts targeting known and newly discovered vulnerabilities in network time protocols\" to execute the payload.\nThe second, alternative method also involves the dropper copying itself to \"\\system32\\ntssrvr32.exe\" on the remote system; however, instead of creating a remote service, this method calls the NetScheduleJobAdd function within the Windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task to run the payload. Scheduled tasks require a time in which the task will run, which the dropper determines by calling the function NetRemoteTOD to obtain the time of day from the remote system. The dropper then adds 90 seconds to the time of day value on the remote system and uses this value as the \"JobTime\" to run the task in three minutes, which executes the payload on the remote system.

Meanwhile, it begins an \"app promotion\" procedure that displays advertisements for other apps to the user. To gain root access, Rootnik first downloads encrypted payloads from a remote server if they do not exist locally then proceeds to attempt exploitation of one of four vulnerabilities. After achieving root access successfully, the malware writes four APK files to the system partition and reboots the compromised device.\nFigure 1: An overview of Rootnik's workflow\nThese four APK files serve as system apps after rebooting, and primarily fall into three categories based on their functionality. Based on the samples we have collected so far the file names of these four APKs are static.\nAndroidSettings.apk \nBluetoothProviders.apk \nWifiProviders.apk \nVirusSecurityHunter.apk\nAndroidSettings.apk is responsible for promoting Android apps and has similar logic to the host malware's app promotion procedure. BluetoothProviders.apk and WifiProviders.apk actually perform identical tasks, they act as a remote control component that can install and uninstall apps as well as download and execute new code from remote servers.\nVirusSecurityHunter.apk is totally a private data-harvesting component, which can steal WiFi information, a victim's location and other potentially sensitive data.",

In this case, the payload was written to the path retrieved fromApplication.DefaultFilePath, which is the default path used by Excel when it opens files.\nThe random name generated for the IcedID payload may be either 1 to 7 random digits, or4500. This is because theRndfunction will return \"a value less than 1 but greater than or equal to zero\".\nOnce the IcedID payload is successfully written to disk, the following post deployment steps are initiated:\nRundll32.exe is copied into a file named calc.exe under the path returned byApplication.DefaultFilePath. \nCalc.exe (renamed rundll32.exe) is used to invoke the IcedID payload.\nIn this case, rundll32.exe was copied into the user Documents folder and named calc.exe. The name 'calc.exe' is hard-coded into the VBA code and will not be changed.\nOnce the VBA macros invoked the IcedID payload, the parent-child process relationship between Excel and calc.exe was observed.\nThe following diagram provides a visual summary of the process to execute IcedID on the endpoint.\nIcedID VNC\nThe threat actors were observed making use of an VNC module that was spawned by IcedID to spawn the Microsoft Edge browser:\nWe were able to reconstruct some of the VNC traffic thanks to@0xThiebaut's toolPCAPeek.

Here is the content of the payload, where we can observe an object being created in memory using an encoded string. We will walk through decoding this string to view the Cobalt Strike configuration present within.\nAfter initial Base64 decoding, we found the payload used thedefault Cobalt Strike XOR value of 35which allows for the next step of decoding the payload.\nSecond stage decoding:\nAfter this an MZ header can be observed. From there, the data can be saved and reviewed using1768.pyfromDidier Stevens, revealing the Cobalt Strike configuration embedded within:\nThe full configuration:\nAfter using PowerShell beacons during the first day on the beachhead host and a Domain Controller, the threat actors moved to using DLL files exclusively for the remainder of Cobalt Strike beacons deployed during the intrusion.

In this case, theshellargument is a beacon command to spawn a new process. Here, we see it mashed between two commands indicating human error.\nFlawedGrace\nTruebot loaded another more complicated payload alongside Cobalt Strike, the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) \"FlawedGrace.\" The initial execution chain of this malware was observed across multiple endpoints when they were first infected.\nThe first observed behavior of this chain was to create a new instance of spoolsv.exe that was shortly accessed by the Truebot process (RuntimeBroker.exe). This process would then spawn instances of msiexec.exe, which would reach out to the initial FlawedGrace C2 of 92.118.36[.]199.\nInstead of creating a task through schtasks.exe, FlawedGrace used three different methods to create new scheduled tasks. The first was to import the taskschd.dll library into the main host process to create a new task called 2. The task was removed as soon as the new command gained SYSTEM-level privileges.\nThe second was observed within obfuscated PowerShell, where the Schedule.Service COM Object was used to create a new task.\nThe last method was to use native PowerShell cmdlets to register a task.\nThe initial task \\2 ran the following command which was scheduled for the next minute after creation:\nThe first working part of the command decodes the obfuscated string and results in the following PowerShell code:\nThe decoded code sets the variable $j to the value {8D81676C-7F63-8F81-676E-666B6C67818D}.

The malware created specific key names attempting to blend in with other COM objects which were also kept within this location. The malware would create additional scheduled tasks using one of the following names selected randomly:\nThe final loaded PowerShell script was stored here:\nThe PowerShell code in TypeLib would decrypt the RC4 encrypted payload stored in ProgID using a key based on the hostname ($env:COMPUTERNAME) of the target host and then inject the DLL into the FlawedGrace msiexec.exe and svchost.exe processes.\nThe encrypted DLL stored in Registry\nWe manually reversed the RC4 function to decrypt the DLL, which matched the same hash as the FlawedGrace processes in memory (c.dll)\nThe PE details of the injected module c.dll was of a DLL with an original name of icuin.dll, claiming to be part of the International Components for Unicode libraries, as see below:\nWhen FlawedGrace attempted to run certain commands on the target host, it displayed the specific behavior of spawning an instance of cmd.exe as a sacrificial intermediate process.\nShortly after these instances of cmd.exe were spawned, they would be accessed by the FlawedGrace process svchost.exe.\nOf note, the arguments in these processes command lines used flags that do not exist (/I, /SI, /O, /SO):\nA Sigma rule to detect this activity can be found at the end of the report.",

Specifically, it touches on two areas of potential concern for a target: financial responsibility and the introduction of a state of uncertainty and confusion. In this case, the role of the target as a processor of financial statements might mean that the target is accustomed to receiving similarly structured legitimate e-mails; accordingly, they may open a malicious attachment without a second thought.\nThe second factor is much broader and relates to how humans deal with uncertainty. Without specific awareness and training, some users may be inclined to open the attachment, wondering why the e-mail was sent to them. In psychology, this is referred to as the\"Need for Closure\" personality trap.\nThe next layer of this attack is found within the malicious DOC file once a victim opens it.

If any of the checks succeed, this results in an infinite sleep function. \nChecks to see if Sample is in the ModuleFileName.   \nChecks to determine if the VolumeSerialNumber equals 0x00CD1A40.   \nChecks to determine if the VolumeSerialNumber equals 0x70144646.   \nChecks to see if sbiedll is loaded.   \nChecks to see if dbghelp is loaded.   \nChecks System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Disk\\Enum for the following values: 005cefc0 \"qemu\"   \n004ee9c0 \"virtual\"   \n004ee9e0 \"vmware\"   \n004eea00 \"xen\"   \n004ee628 \"ffffcce24\" \nIn cases where the malware does not detect it is operating in a sandbox environment, it then takes steps to achieve persistence on infected systems. First, the malware calculates a \"SystemId\" value which is used to uniquely identify the infected system. This value is calculated based upon ComputerName, Primary hard drive serial number as well as a pre-shared value. The malware then calculates the folder location and filename used to store a PE32 file that will be run each time the infected system is rebooted. The folder location is based on the first eight bytes of the SystemId (/YYYYYYYY/). The filename is based on the final eight bytes of the SystemId (XXXXXXXX.exe). \nThe malware then creates a registry entry that is used to ensure the malware is executed each time the system is restarted. To determine where to create the registry entry, the malware selects a random subkey within HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software (ZZZZZZZZ). It will then create the registry entry that achieves persistence. An example is below: \nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run ZZZZZZZZ : C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\YYYYYYYY\\xXXxXXXX.exe \nA malicious executable is then copied to the following folder location, which is referenced in the registry entry previously created. \nC:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\YYYYYYYY\\XXXXXXXX.exe \nIf the malware receives plugin code to run then that is saved to the following location: \nC:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\YYYYYYYY\\YYYYYYYY ",

Let's first look at its earlier variant and then discuss the 2023 changes.\nScService, as the name suggests, is a component run as a Windows service and acts as a simple backdoor. The service parameters are shown in Table6. The service description was taken from the official legitimate WindowsSensor Monitoring Service.\nTable6. ScService parameters\nAs with ScInstaller, ScService also drops a custom TLS certificate, identical to the one used by ScInstaller. If the INI file (created by ScInstaller) is not present, one with empty values is created.\nOnce launched, ScService creates three timers, one each that:\n1.sends aKEEPmessage to the C&C server every 10 seconds,\n2.flushes the DNS cache every five hours by executing ipconfig /flushdns, and\n3.connects to the C&C server every five minutes.\nFigure16demonstrates the use of the custom certificate when establishing a connection to the C&C server. ScService uses multiple C&C servers, all hardcoded and encrypted in the binary.\nAside from establishing a TLS connection, ScService communicates with the C&C server via TCP on port 443. The protocol is very straightforward; no additional encryption is employed. Once ScService receives data, it scans the data for known command names and executes any such command, optionally sending back a response. ScService recognizes the six commands shown inTable7. Command name and its parameters are delimited by#. In short, ScService can execute arbitrary commands and executables, open and close an SSH tunnel, obtain machine info, and update the INI file.\nTable7. TCP/IP commands capability",

The dropper obtains a date used to activate the wiping functionality by reading a specific file, or using a hardcoded timestamp of \"2016/11/17 20:45\". The file containing this timestamp is named \"\\inf\\usbvideo324.pnf\", which is not initially installed but is provided by the C2 server if it sends the communications module the \"T\" command. The \"usbvideo324.pnf\" file would have the following structure:\nBYTE year;BYTE month;BYTE day;BYTE hour;BYTE year;BYTE minute;\nIf the dropper determines the system date is larger than the specified date, the dropper will extract the wiper component from a resource named \"PKCS12\" and save it to the \"system32\" folder with one of the following filenames appended with a \".exe\" extension:\ncaclsrv \ncertutl \nclean \nctrl \ndfrag \ndnslookup \ndvdquery \nevent \nfindfile \ngpget \nipsecure \niissrv \nmsinit \nntfrsutil \nntdsutl \npower \nrdsadmin \nregsys \nsigver \nrouteman \nrrasrv \nsacses \nsfmsc \nsmbinit \nwcscript \nntnw \nnetx \nfsutl \nextract\nThe dropper then runs the wiper component with a command line argument of \"1\". The wiper component extracts a driver from its resource section and decrypts it with a 226 byte XOR key. The wiper saves the extracted driver to \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\drdisk.sys\" and installs the kernel driver by creating a service named \"drdisk\" with the following command line commands:\nThe kernel driver is a commercial product that the attackers are abusing called RawDisk by EldoS Corporation, which provides direct access to files, disks and partitions. It appears that the \"drdisk.sys\" driver (SHA256: 4744df6ac02ff0a3f9ad0bf47b15854bbebb73c936dd02f7c79293a2828406f6) is the exact same driver as used in the Shamoon attack in 2012. With the kernel driver installed, the wiper can begin writing to protected system locations, such as the master boot record (MBR) and partition tables of storage volumes. The wiper can be configured to overwrite files in three different ways, specified by a configuration setting of \"F\", \"R\" or \"E\". If configured with the \"F\" setting, the wiper loads a resource named AJKEOA, which extracts a JPEG image to use to overwrite files and partition tables. If the wiper is configured with the \"E\" setting, the wiper will encrypt the contents of the file using a random value as a key and the RC4 algorithm. If configured with the \"R\" setting, the wiper will overwrite files with the random values that would be used as a key in \"E\".\nThe sample we analyzed was configured with \"F\", meaning it would overwrite files with an image obtained from its resource section. The image extracted is a picture of a Syrian boy named Alan Kurdi, whose drowning on September 2, 2015 received international attention in regards to the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis. The previous Shamoon attack in 2012 used an image of a burning American flag, continuing the political image theme.\nFrom a functionality standpoint, the wiper relies on EldoS' RawDisk driver to overwrite files on the system. During this activity, we noticed the wiper changing the system time to August 2012, as the temporary license key for the RawDisk driver requires the system time to not exceed the month of August, which is when the temporary license would expire. This modification to the system time was seen in the previous campaign, and the temporary license key within the wiper component is the exact same as wiper component from the 2012 attacks. The wiper itself queries the following registry keys to obtain a list of partitions to overwrite:\nIn addition to these partitions, the wiper attempts to overwrite files and subfolders within in the following folders:\nAfter overwriting these files and the partition tables, the wiper issues the following command to restart the system:\nThe arguments and switches used in the \"shutdown\" command above forces all running applications to close and causes the system to reboot ('-r') after 2 seconds ('-t 2'). This command does result in a dialog prompt, seen in Figure 1, that informs the user that the system is shutting down.\nFigure 1 Dialog prompt displayed when the Wiper component runs the 'shutdown' command\nWith the partition tables overwritten, the system will no longer be able to properly boot, which renders the system unusable. During analysis, our analysis system was rendered unusable, as the virtual machine was unable to find the operating system during boot up, as seen in Figure 2.\nFigure 2 Analysis virtual machine unable to boot after executing Disttrack Wiper",

Through this tunnel, the threat actor was able to proxy their access from the beachhead to other assets in the network using a handful of different techniques, including WMI, and RDP.\nAs mentioned in the discovery section, Impacket's atexec module was utilized within the SSH tunnel to proxy traffic to a domain controller to assist with lateral movement. In between executions of atexec, we see Windows Security event logs that match behavior of lateral movement:\nSMB\nDuring the intrusion, the threat actor used SMB to copy files over to other systems. Here, the files were not sent over the network in the clear, preventing network inspection, but we were able to inspect the file creation and deletion via event ID 5145 for File Share Auditing event. In the logs, we can see the AccessMask of 0x2 during the file write followed by 0x10080 during the file delete action.\nWMI\nImpacket's wmiexec tool was used to pivot across the environment, extract the archived filecache.cab, and execute scheduled tasks to run NetSupport RAT on remote systems.\nFor a breakdown of the process command line arguments, refer to this previousreport.\nRDP\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) was used from the beachhead to two servers and two domain controllers on the network. We can verify this activity with Windows Event ID 4624 with logon type 10. This log triggers whenever a user successfully logs on to a computer or server via remote interactive logon (RDP or other remote desktop services).\nBelow illustrates the threat actor initiating RDP sessions from the beachhead to various servers within the network on day eight of this intrusion.\nBelow, illustrates the full network architecture and lateral movement seen within this incident.\nDuring the intrusion, the threat actor revealed two different host names leaked in various Windows Event logs during their RDP sessions.\nExample Windows event ID 4776:\nExample Windows event ID 4624:\nExample Windows event ID 4779:",
