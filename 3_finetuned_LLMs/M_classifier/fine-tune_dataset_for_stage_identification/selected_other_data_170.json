[{"title": "Targeting", "content": "Mandiant has no information to indicate that any of the PE infectors we uncovered were specifically targeting OT systems. Due to the worm-like nature of many PE infectors, there are multiple scenarios and attack vectors in which OT assets can become infected, most often without being specifically targeted. Table 1 provides a non-exhaustive list of examples. \nPE infectors often propagate by scanning filesystems, memory, local drives, network shares, and portable media for clean PE files and, once located, alter the clean PE by appending malicious code. For example, when the malware finds a file such as \"EventViewer.exe\", a legitimate Honeywell software used to view security alarms, it appends itself to the executable but keeps the original name and the program functionality. Procedures used to execute this vary in complexity among different families and variants of PE infectors. Table 2 presents a random sample of infected OT OEM binaries we uncovered. \nPE infected malware introduced in OT environments can propagate quickly where protection levels are consistent throughout systems and networks. For example, if the initial infection vector is through portable media due to a lack of implementation of scanning and sanitization controls, then asset ", "source": "mandiant", "type": "attack target"}, {"title": "Targets", "content": "While the previous Turla campaigns were designed to target Windows-based machines, the campaign in August 2014  was the first instance where Turla targeted the Linux operating system.

As the largest recipient of Chinese investment in Latin America, this volume of PRC cyber espionage is reminiscent of activity in other regions where Chinese government investment has been focused, such as countries within China's Belt and Road Initiative. In addition to activity targeting Gmail users, PRC groups have targeted Brazil's military, national government, diplomatic organizations, and the provincial governments of multiple Brazilian states. These groups have targeted users in Brazil using tactics ranging from phishing to malware distribution and exploitation of known vulnerabilities. \nIn August 2023, for example, Google detected a campaign from a PRC group that targeted nearly two hundred users in a Brazilian executive branch organization. The phishing emails contained links to an encrypted ZIP archive hosted on a known phishing domain. Organizations in Brazil's state governments have also been a target. In late 2022, PRC actors used an operational relay box (ORB) network to anonymize their activity and attempted to send a mass phishing campaign to nearly two thousand email addresses, including 70 email addresses in the .br ccTLD, the majority of which belonged to Brazilian state government organizations. The mass email, which Gmail blocked, contained a malicious TAR attachment designed to exploit CVE-2022-41352, an n-day vulnerability in the Zimbra Collaboration Suite that enables an attacker to upload arbitrary files and gain unauthorized access to other user accounts.

"source": "Fortinet", "type": "IoC"}, {"title": "IOC", "content": "While processing the IOCTL_REQUEST packets, function smb2_dispatch_ioctl_request is invoked with supplied packet bytes as its arguments. In turn, it calls smb2::extract(uchar \\*&,uchar \\* const&,smb2::ioctl_request &,uchar \\* const&) which extracts different fields from the packet into IOCTL_REQUEST structure. \nA code path exists in \"smb2::extract\" that can leave a stack buffer uninitialized while still succeeding. This pointer actually resides on the calling function's stack, is uninitialized and contains random data. When it is subsequently used, it can lead to a crash or further memory corruption if contents can be controlled. \nUninitialized stack variables are rarely exploitable, so to demonstrate control over the uninitialized stack area, the attached PoC constructs a special, compound, SMB command. To control the stack contents, we need to find a function that gives us control of its own stack.

Noting that there are other cybercriminal business models where more illicit money can be made, and the changing geopolitical and economic conditions affecting this illegal enterprise, we looked at the possible triggers that can lead to gradual alterations in how we have observed ransomware business models are designed and operated.\nThis blog post discusses some of the possible triggers, detailed in \"The Near and Far Future of Ransomware Business Models,\" that can push Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) groups to make small changes in their current operations (in the section we call \"Evolutions\"). Looking further ahead and considering the aggregation of these triggers and small changes, we look at the potentially larger modifications these groups can make to further other possible objectives in the long run (in the section \"Revolutions\"). While we identify five key points for impact in our research, this entry focuses on three points for discussion:\nWhen compelled, ransomware actors will adapt and adopt other criminal business models - online or offline - that monetize initial access, such as short and distort scheme or other forms of stock fraud, business email compromise (BEC), and cryptocurrency theft, among others. \nRansomware actors are expected to evolve and deploy routines with more automation, better operational security (OpSec), and adding new cloud targets and internet of things (IoT) platforms. Linux ransomware will likewise continue to grow. \nCryptocurrency crime is expected to grow significantly, and ransomware actors are expected to be involved in crypto crime sooner or later.\nKey Underground Services That Enable Ransomware\nOver the years, ransomware evolved to become a fusion of previously deployed threats that extorted the public. From this angle, we see that ransomware groups and their business models have never remained static and have considered themselves as profitable business ventures that need to constantly adjust with the changing technology and environment. This begs the question, where can ransomware go next?\nTo answer this question, we should consider the building blocks of today's ransomware models, varied and customized at each block and turn by ransomware groups to suit their needs in relation to their targets' environments. Each block can be seen as separate entities contributing to a whole ecosystem functioning:\nInitial access: Attackers find an entry vector into the targeted victim's network. Launching an email campaign with backdoor payloads, sending specifically crafted social engineering campaigns aimed at enterprises, exploiting vulnerabilities, and buying credentials from the underground are just some examples of ways to gain access to systems. \nLateral movement and privilege escalation: Attackers navigate deeper and around the victim's network with standard or customized hacking tools. \nSensitive data exfiltration: Attackers find sensitive information in the machines and steal it. Sifting through the data can also occur while navigating the victim machines or after exfiltration, allowing the threat actors to determine the ransom amount or if the victim has cyber insurance. \nBackup systems' disruption: Attackers disrupt and damage backup systems and processes in order to lower the victim's chances of restoring machines and recovering data on their own. \nRansomware payload deployment: Attackers encrypt files and IT systems, disrupting operations. \nExtortion methods: Attackers demand payment in exchange for the decryption keys to recover files and restore systems. Additional extortion methods are imposed on the victims if they choose not to pay the ransom. \nMoney laundering: Attackers launder their money via cryptocurrency to mask the real identities of the ransom beneficiaries. These are often done via cryptocurrency exchanges, mixers, or combinations of other tricky means.\nTriggers for change\nMuch like legitimate enterprises, ransomware groups see their deployment and attacks as businesses delve into business development. This coincides with internal and external changes that significantly mark and affect their operations. This section provides two examples of triggers that affect the key points for discussion.

We call the first campaign \"Contagious Interview,\" where threat actors pose as employers (often anonymously or with vague identities) to lure software developers into installing malware through the interview process. This malware creates the potential for various types of theft. We attribute with moderate confidence that Contagious Interview is run by a North Korea state-sponsored threat actor.\nWe call the second campaign \"Wagemole,\" where threat actors seek unauthorized employment with organizations based in the US and other parts of the world, with potential for both financial gain and espionage. We attribute with high confidence that Wagemole is a North Korea state-sponsored threat. Activity from both campaigns remains an ongoing active threat.\nWe nicknamed the first campaign Contagious Interview because the threat actor attempts to infect software developers with malware through a fictitious job interview. We originally discovered Contagious Interview through customer telemetry, and our research indicates it started as early as December 2022. Some of the infrastructure supporting this campaign remains active, and this activity remains a consistent threat. The first campaign's objective is likely cryptocurrency theft and using compromised targets as a staging environment for additional attacks. We track Contagious Interview as CL-STA-0240.\nWhile pivoting on indicators from Contagious Interview, we discovered exposed files on a different threat actor-controlled infrastructure. These files indicate fraudulent job-seeking activity targeting a wide variety of United States (US) companies. This trove of information includes resumes with different technical skill sets and multiple identities impersonating individuals from various nations. It also includes common job interview questions and answers, scripts for interviews and downloaded job postings from US companies. We call this separate campaign \"Wagemole\" and track it as CL-STA-0241.\nWhile we cannot determine the objective of this campaign, the US Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have reported that North Koreauses remote workers to funnel wages to its weapons programs.\nDuring our investigation of Contagious Interview, we discovered two new families of malware we named BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret. BeaverTail is JavaScript-based malware hidden inside Node Package Manager (NPM) packages. InvisibleFerret is a simple but powerful Python-based backdoor. Both are cross-platform malware that can run on Windows, Linux and macOS.\nThis article provides an overview of these two campaigns, and we examine the two new malware families, BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret.\nThis article also provides insight on how these threat actors are both seeking jobs and targeting job seekers to accomplish their goals.

The campaign was uncovered in spring 2015: Kaspersky Lab was invited to conduct a forensic investigation of a bank's systems after some of its ATMs started to dispense cash 'randomly'. It turned out that the bank was infected. Carbanak is a backdoor designed to carry out espionage, data exfiltration and remote control of infected computers. The attackers used APT-style methods to compromise their victims \u2013 sending spearphishing e-mails to bank employees. Once installed on a bank's computer, the attackers carried out reconnaissance to identify systems related to processing, accounting and ATMs and simply mimicked the activities of legitimate employees. Carbanak used three methods to steal money: (1) dispensing cash from ATMs, (2) transferring money to cybercriminals using the SWIFT network and (3) creating fake accounts and using mule services to collect the money. The attackers targeted around 100 financial institutions, with total losses amounting to almost $\\$1$ billion. \nOne of most talked-about news stories of Q1 2015 surrounded the Equation cyber-espionage group. The attackers behind Equation successfully infected the computers of thousands of victims in Iran, ps://securelist.com/kaspersky-security-bulletin-2015-top-security-stories/72886/ \nRussia, Syria, Afghanistan, the United States and elsewhere \u2013 victims included government and diplomatic institutions, telecommunications companies and energy firms. This is one of the most sophisticated APT campaigns we've seen: one of the many modules developed by the group modifies the firmware of hard drives \u2013 providing a level of stealth and persistence beyond other targeted attacks. It's clear that development of the code stretches back to 2001 or earlier. It's also related to other notorious attacks, Stuxnet and Flame \u2013 for example, its arsenal included two zero-day vulnerabilities that were later to be used in Stuxnet. \nWhile investigating an incident in the Middle East, we uncovered the activity of a previously unknown group conducting targeted attacks. Desert Falcons is the first Arabic-speaking group that has been seen conducting full-scale cyber-espionage operations \u2013 apparently connected with the political situation in the region. The first signs of this campaign date back to 2011. The first infections took place in 2013, although the peak of activity was in late 2014 and early 2015. The group has stolen over 1 million files from more than 3,000 victims. The victims include political activists and leaders, government and military organizations, mass media and financial institutions \u2013 located primarily in Palestine, Egypt, Israel and Jordan.

", "source": "Cisco", "type": "attack background"}, {"title": "Introduction", "content": "Let's go over the vulnerability overview given by the runC team:\nThe vulnerability allows a malicious container to (with minimal user interaction) overwrite the host runc binary and thus gain root-level code execution on the host. The level of user interaction is being able to run any command ... as root within a container in either of these contexts:\nCreating a new container using an attacker-controlled image. \nAttaching (docker exec) into an existing container which the attacker had previous write access to.\nThose two scenarios might seem different, but both require runC to spin up a new process in a container and are implemented similarly. In both cases, runC is tasked with running a user-defined binary in the container. In Docker, this binary is either the image's entry point when starting a new container, or docker exec's argument when attaching to an existing container.\nWhen this user binary is run, it must already be confined and restricted inside the container, or it can jeopardize the host. In order to accomplish that, runC creates a 'runC init' subprocess which places all needed restrictions on itself (such as entering or setting up namespaces) and effectively places itself in the container. Then, the runC init process, now in the container,callsthe execve syscall to overwrite itself with the user requested binary.\nThis is the method used by runC both for creating new containers and for attaching a process to an existing container.\nThe researchers who revealed the vulnerability discovered that an attacker can trick runC into executing itself by asking it to run /proc/self/exe, which is a symbolic link to the runC binary on the host.\nAn attacker with root access in the container can then use /proc/[runc-pid]/exe as a reference to the runC binary onthe hostand overwrite it. Root access in the container is required to perform this attack as the runC binary is owned by root.The next time runC is executed, the attacker will achieve code execution on the host. Since runC is normally run as root (e.g. by the Docker daemon), the attacker will gain root access on the host.\nThe image above might mislead some to believe the vulnerability (i.e. tricking runC into executing itself) is redundant. That is, why can't an attacker simply overwrite /proc/[runc-init-pid]/exe instead?A patch for a similar runC vulnerability,CVE-2016-9962, mitigates this kind of attack.CVE-2016-9962 revealed that the runC init process possessed open file descriptors from the host which could be used by an attacker in the container to traverse the host's filesystem and thus break out of the container. Part of the patch for this flaw was setting the runc init process as 'non-dumpable' before it entering the container.\nIn the context of CVE-2019-5736, the 'non-dumpable' flag denies other processes from dereferencing /proc/[pid]/exe, and therefore mitigates overwriting the runC binary through /proc/[runc-init-pid]/exe[1]. Calling execve drops this flag though, and hence the new runC process' /proc/[runc-pid]/exe is accessible.\nThe vulnerability may appear to contradict the way symbolic links are implemented in Linux.Symbolic links simply hold the path to their target. For a runC process, /proc/self/exe should contain something like /usr/sbin/runc.When a symlink is accessed by a process, the kernel uses the path present in the link to find the target under the root of the accessing process.That begs the question \u2013when a process in the container opens the symbolic link to the runC binary, why doesn't the kernel searches for the runC path inside the container root?\nThe answer is that /proc/[pid]/exe does not follow the normal semantics for symbolic links. Technically this might count as a violation ofPOSIX, but as I mentioned earlier procfs is a special filesystem. When a process opens /proc/[pid]/exe, there is none of the normal procedure of reading and following the contents of a symlink.

Spaghetti code makes the program flow hard to read by adding continuous code jumps, hence the name. An example of FinFisher's spaghetti code is shown below. \nThis problem is not novel, and in common situations there are known reversing plugins that may help for this task. In the case of FinFisher, however, we could not find a good existing interactive disassembler (IDA) plugin that can normalize the code flow. So we decided to write our own plugin code using IDA Python. Armed with this code, we removed this first layer of anti-analysis protection. \nRemoving the junk instructions revealed a readable block of code. This code starts by allocating two chunks of memory: a global 1 MB buffer and one 64 KB buffer per thread. The big first buffer is used as index for multiple concurrent threads. A big chunk of data is extracted from the portable executable (PE) file itself and decrypted two times using a custom XOR algorithm. We determined that this chunk of data contains an array of opcode instructions ready to be interpreted by a custom virtual machine program (from this point on referenced generically as $^{\\prime\\prime}\\backslash{\\sf M}^{\\prime\\prime})$ implemented by FinFisher authors.

We discovered that the framework, which is used by numerous apps, had a \"BROWSABLE\" service activity that an attacker could remotely invoke to exploit several vulnerabilities that could allow adversaries to implant a persistent backdoor or take substantial control over the device. \nThe framework seemed to be designed to offer self-diagnostic mechanisms to identify and resolve issues impacting the Android device, indicating its permissions were inherently broad with access to valuable resources. For example, the framework was authorized to access system resources and perform system-related tasks, like adjusting the device's audio, camera, power, and storage controls. Moreover, we found that the framework was being used by default system applications to leverage its self-diagnostic capabilities, demonstrating that the affiliated apps also included extensive device privileges that could be exploited via the vulnerable framework. \nAccording to mce Systems, some of these vulnerabilities also affected other apps on both Android and iOS devices. Moreover, the vulnerable framework and affiliated apps were found on devices from large international mobile service providers. mce Systems, which offers \"Mobile Device Lifecycle and Automation Technologies,\" also permitted providers to customize and brand their respective mobile apps and frameworks. Pre-installed frameworks and mobile apps such as mce Systems' are beneficial to users and providers in areas like simplifying the device activation process, troubleshooting device issues, and optimizing performance. However, their extensive control over the device to deliver these kinds of services could also make them an attractive target for attackers. \nOur analysis further found that the apps were embedded in the devices' system image, suggesting that they were default applications installed by phone providers. All of the apps are available on the Google Play Store where they go through Google Play Protect's automatic safety checks, but these checks previously did not scan for these types of issues. As part of our effort to help ensure broad protection against these issues, we shared our research with Google, and Google Play Protect now identifies these types of vulnerabilities. \nWe initially discovered the vulnerabilities in September 2021 and shared our findings with mce Systems and affected mobile service providers through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR). We worked closely with mce Systems' security and engineering teams to mitigate these vulnerabilities, which included mce Systems sending an urgent framework update to the impacted providers and releasing fixes for the issues. At the time of publication, there have been no reported signs of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. \nThe high-severity vulnerabilities, which have a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of 7.0-8.9, are now identified as CVE-2021-42598, CVE-2021- 42599, CVE-2021-42600, and CVE-2021-42601. We want to thank mce Systems' engineering teams for collaborating quickly and efficiently in resolving these issues as well as to AT&T for proactively working with Microsoft to ensure customers can safely continue to use the framework. \nSeveral other mobile service providers were found using the vulnerable framework with their respective apps, suggesting that there could be additional providers still undiscovered that may be impacted. The affected providers linked below have made updated app versions available to users before this disclosure, ensuring devices can be protected before these vulnerabilities could be exploited.

On May 19, one such sample was uploaded to VirusTotal, where it received a benign verdict from all 56 vendors that evaluated it. Beyond the obvious detection concerns, we believe this sample is also significant in terms of its malicious payload, command and control (C2), and packaging.\nThe sample contained a malicious payload associated withBrute Ratel C4(BRc4), the newest red-teaming and adversarial attack simulation tool to hit the market. While this capability has managed to stay out of the spotlight and remains less commonly known than itsCobalt Strikebrethren, it is no less sophisticated. Instead, this tool is uniquely dangerous in that it was specifically designed to avoid detection by endpoint detection and response (EDR) and antivirus (AV) capabilities. Its effectiveness at doing so can clearly be witnessed by the aforementioned lack of detection across vendors on VirusTotal.\nIn terms of C2, we found that the sample called home to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) IP address located in the United States over port 443. Further, the X.509 certificate on the listening port was configured to impersonate Microsoft with an organization name of \"Microsoft\" and organization unit of \"Security.\" Additionally, pivoting on the certificate and other artifacts, we identified a total of 41 malicious IP addresses, nine BRc4 samples, and an additional three organizations across North and South America who have been impacted by this tool so far.\nThis unique sample was packaged in a manner consistent with knownAPT29techniques and their recent campaigns, which leveraged well-known cloud storage and online collaboration applications. Specifically, this sample was packaged as a self-contained ISO. Included in the ISO was a Windows shortcut (LNK) file, a malicious payload DLL and a legitimate copy of Microsoft OneDrive Updater. Attempts to execute the benign application from the ISO-mounted folder resulted in the loading of the malicious payload as a dependency through a technique known as DLL search order hijacking. However, while packaging techniques alone are not enough to definitively attribute this sample to APT29, these techniques demonstrate that users of the tool are now applying nation-state tradecraft to deploy BRc4.\nOverall, we believe this research is significant in that it identifies not only a new red team capability that is largely undetectable by most cybersecurity vendors, but more importantly, a capability with a growing user base that we assess is now leveraging nation-state deployment techniques.

Unlike previously discussed samples, thislatestinstance of Cardinal RAT employs various obfuscation techniques to hinder analysis of the underlying code. The first layer of obfuscation comes in the form of steganography;the initial sample is compiled with .NET and contains an embedded bitmap (BMP) file.\nFigure1.Embedded BMP file contained within .NET loader\nUpon execution, the malware will read this file, parse out pixel data from the image, and decrypt the result using a single-byte XOR key.We have provided aPython script to automate this process in the Appendix of the blog post.

Afterwards,it createsthe following directory:\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\IEConfig\nIt then writes an embedded executable with the hash below to %TEMP%\\[random].exe. This file has an internal filename of RunExecutive.exe and simply copies the contents of argument #2 to the file path specified in argument #1.\nThe malware creates anLNK file in the victim's startup folder witharandomly generatedfilename using aGUID (Example:{fcb29182-b3cc-47e2-a95c-b22c6d87dda1}.lnk).

Throughout July 2020 we attributed three intrusions to UNC2198 from Incident Response engagements, including one resulting in the deployment of MAZE ransomware. In October 2020, a slew of activity at both Incident Response engagements and Managed Defense clients resulted in the creation of two new UNC groups, and another incident attributed to UNC2198. \nOne of the new UNC groups created in October 2020 was given the designation UNC2374. UNC2374 began as its own distinct cluster where BEACON, \nWINDARC, and SYSTEMBC were observed during an incident at a Managed Defense customer. Initial similarities in tooling did not constitute a strong enough link to merge UNC2374 with UNC2198 yet. \nTwo and a half months following the creation of UNC2374, we amassed enough data points to merge UNC2374 into UNC2198.

UNC2374 and UNC2198 BEACON C2 servers were accessed by the same victim system within a 10-minute time window during intrusion operations. \nThe other UNC group created in October 2020 was given the designation UNC2414. Three separate intrusions were attributed to UNC2414, and as the cluster grew, we surfaced similarities between UNC2414 and UNC2198. A subset of the data points used to merge UNC2414 into UNC2198 include: \nUNC2198 and UNC2414 BEACON servers used self-signed certificates using the following subject on TCP port 25055: \n${\\mathsf{C}}={\\mathsf{U}}{\\mathsf{S}}$ , ST $=$ CA, L $=$ California, $0=$ Oracl \nUNC2198 and UNC2414 installed BEACON as   \nC:\\Windows\\int32.dll   \nUNC2198 and UNC2414 installed the RCLONE   \nutility as C:\\Perflogs\\rclone.exe   \nUNC2198 and UNC2414 were proven to be   \nfinancially motivated actors that had leveraged   \nICEDID as initial access: UNC2198 had deployed MAZE UNC2414 had deployed EGREGOR \nThe merge between UNC2198 and UNC2414 was significant because it revealed UNC2198 has access to EGREGOR ransomware.

We have traced these intrusions back to July 2018, and they have reportedly cost victims tens of millions of dollars. As the frequency of these intrusions deploying ransomware have increased, the cadence of activity traditionally attributed to FIN6-intrusions targeting point-of-sale (POS) environments, deploying TRINITY malware and sharing other key characteristics-has declined. Given that, FIN6 may have evolved as a whole to focus on these extortive intrusions. However, based on tactical differences between these ransomware incidents and historical FIN6 activity, it is also possible that some FIN6 operators have been carrying out ransomware deployment intrusions independently of the group's payment card breaches. Which of those scenarios is happening would influence how pressing a threat the group's card data breach tactics continue to be. Criminal operations and relationships are highly adaptable, so we commonly encounter such attribution challenges in regards to criminal activity.
