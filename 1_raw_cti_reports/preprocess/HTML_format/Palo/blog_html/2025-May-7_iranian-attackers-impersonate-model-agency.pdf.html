This infrastructure hosted a fraudulent website designed to mimic the authentic agency\u2019s branding and content.\r\n\r\nVisitors unknowingly triggered obfuscated JavaScript designed to capture detailed visitor information, such as:\r\n\r\n \tBrowser languages\r\n \tScreen resolutions\r\n \tIP addresses\r\n \tBrowser fingerprints\r\n\r\nAttackers likely collected these data points to enable selective targeting.\r\n\r\nThe website replaces a real model's profile with a fake one, including a currently inactive link to a private album. This suggests preparation for targeted social engineering attacks, likely using the fake profile as a lure. We have not yet observed direct victim interaction, though it is possible victims would arrive at the fake website through spear phishing.\r\n\r\nThe operation's complexity, methods and targeting lead us to believe with high confidence that these are the actions of an Iranian threat group. With lower confidence, we suspect a group overlapping with Agent Serpens, also known as APT35 or Charming Kitten, is behind this campaign. This group is known for conducting espionage campaigns against Iranian dissidents, journalists and activists, particularly those living abroad.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we will cover details of the fake website\u2019s functionality, including the obfuscated data collection routines and the fictitious profile likely used for social engineering.\r\n\r\nIndividuals and organizations, particularly those involved with Iranian activist communities, should remain vigilant for similar operations and treat unsolicited contacts cautiously before engaging.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected through the following products and services:\r\n\r\n \tAdvanced URL Filtering and Advanced DNS Security identify known domains and URLs associated with this activity as malicious.\r\n \tAdvanced Threat Prevention has an inbuilt machine learning-based detection that can detect exploits in real time.\r\n\r\nIf you think you might have been compromised or have an urgent matter, contact the Unit 42 Incident Response team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated Unit 42 Topics\r\nIran, Phishing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Analysis of the Fake Mega Model Agency Site\r\nWhile monitoring infrastructure we assess is likely tied to Iranian cyber actors, we discovered the domain megamodelstudio[.]com. This domain was registered on Feb. 18, 2025, and has resolved to 64.72.205[.]32 since March 1, 2025. This domain hosts a website impersonating the Hamburg-based Mega Model Agency, as illustrated in Figure 1.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_140296\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"896\"] Figure 1. Fake Mega Model Agency website.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis actor-created website closely replicates the actual website's branding, layout and content. However, the clone includes an obfuscated script designed to harvest detailed visitor information and potentially lure specific targets to a fictitious model\u2019s profile.\r\n\r\nThis fake website exhibits the hallmarks of social engineering attacks performed by known Iranian advanced persistent threat groups (APTs). Most notably, it appears to link to Agent Serpens, a threat actor that the security community has widely reported to perform espionage campaigns against individuals and organizations critical of the Iranian regime, including in Germany [PDF].\r\n\r\nUpon visiting any page of the fake website, obfuscated JavaScript code runs in the victim\u2019s browser. The likely goal of the code is to enable selective targeting by determining sufficient device- and network-specific details about visitors.\r\n\r\nThe script performs the following tasks:\r\n\r\n \tEnumerating browser languages and plugins, retrieve screen resolution and collect timestamps to track a visitor\u2019s locale and environment\r\n \tRevealing the user\u2019s local and public IP address using WebRTC-based IP address leaking\r\n \tLeveraging canvas fingerprinting, using SHA-256 to produce a device-unique hash\r\n\r\n \tCanvas fingerprinting is a technique that uses the HTML5 canvas element to identify unique characteristics about a user\u2019s device and generate a corresponding fingerprint\r\n\r\n\r\n \tStructuring the collected data (e.g., language, screen size, canvas hash) as JSON and delivering it to the endpoint \/ads\/track via a POST request\r\n\r\n \tThis naming convention suggests an attempt to disguise the collection as benign advertising traffic rather than storing and processing potential target fingerprints\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to its data collection routines, the fake website contains functionality designed to dynamically alter on-page references to a specific model and replace them with details and images of a model named \u201cShir Benzion.\u201d We assess that this replacement profile is likely fictitious and part of a social engineering tactic.\r\n\r\nAttackers also inject a link to a private album into the profile for this fictitious model, though it appears to be non-functional at the time of writing. We assess that this is likely a placeholder intended for targeted social engineering attacks, potentially serving as a mechanism for harvesting credentials or delivering malware payloads. We illustrate these observations in Figures 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_140307\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"891\"] Figure 2. Top: Legitimate Mega Model Agency women\u2019s page. Bottom: Fake page with profile of a real model replaced by the fictitious \u201cShir Benzion\u201d profile.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_140318\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"891\"] Figure 3. Fictitious \u201cShir Benzion\u201d profile with private album lure.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe fake website\u2019s current functionality, combined with the potential for further malicious development, indicates that this campaign is both an ongoing and evolving threat.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis operation, involving detailed visitor profiling and sophisticated impersonation tactics, demonstrates a continued escalation in suspected Iranian cyberespionage activity. Such activities present significant risks to various organizations and individuals, such as those advocating for or supporting Iranian dissidents.\r\n\r\nIndividuals and organizations should treat unsolicited contacts offering seemingly appealing opportunities cautiously. People should independently verify the legitimacy of contacts, websites and offers before engaging or sharing sensitive information.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed in this article through the following products and services:\r\n\r\n \tAdvanced URL Filtering and Advanced DNS Security subscriptions for the Next-Generation Firewall identify known domains and URLs associated with this activity as malicious.\r\n \tAdvanced Threat Prevention has an inbuilt machine learning-based detection that can detect exploits in real time.\r\n\r\nIf you think you may have been compromised or have an urgent matter, get in touch with the Unit 42 Incident Response team or call:\r\n\r\n \tNorth America: Toll Free: +1 (866) 486-4842 (866.4.UNIT42)\r\n \tUK: +44.20.3743.3660\r\n \tEurope and Middle East: +31.20.299.3130\r\n \tAsia: +65.6983.8730\r\n \tJapan: +81.50.1790.0200\r\n \tAustralia: +61.2.4062.7950\r\n \tIndia: 00080005045107\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks has shared these findings with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) members.

This infrastructure hosted a fraudulent website designed to mimic the authentic agency’s branding and content.</p><p>Visitors unknowingly triggered obfuscated JavaScript designed to capture detailed visitor information, such as:</p><ul>
<li>Browser languages</li>
<li>Screen resolutions</li>
<li>IP addresses</li>
<li>Browser fingerprints</li>
</ul><p>Attackers likely collected these data points to enable selective targeting.</p><p>The website replaces a real model's profile with a fake one, including a currently inactive link to a private album. This suggests preparation for targeted social engineering attacks, likely using the fake profile as a lure. We have not yet observed direct victim interaction, though it is possible victims would arrive at the fake website through spear phishing.</p><p>The operation's complexity, methods and targeting lead us to believe with high confidence that these are the actions of an Iranian threat group. With lower confidence, we suspect a group overlapping with <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-actor-groups-tracked-by-palo-alto-networks-unit-42/#:~:text=Government-,Agent%20Serpens,-Also%20Known%20As" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agent Serpens</a>, also known as APT35 or Charming Kitten, is behind this campaign. This group is known for conducting espionage campaigns against Iranian dissidents, journalists and activists, particularly those living abroad.</p><p>In this article, we will cover details of the fake website’s functionality, including the obfuscated data collection routines and the fictitious profile likely used for social engineering.</p><p>Individuals and organizations, particularly those involved with Iranian activist communities, should remain vigilant for similar operations and treat unsolicited contacts cautiously before engaging.</p><p>Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected through the following products and services:</p><ul>

However, the clone includes an obfuscated script designed to harvest detailed visitor information and potentially lure specific targets to a fictitious model’s profile.</p><p>This fake website exhibits the hallmarks of social engineering attacks performed by known Iranian advanced persistent threat groups (APTs). Most notably, it appears to link to Agent Serpens, a threat actor that the security community has widely reported to perform espionage campaigns against individuals and organizations critical of the Iranian regime, <a href="https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/SharedDocs/publikationen/EN/cyber/2023-08-10-cyber-brief-no-01-2023.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including in Germany [PDF]</a>.</p><p>Upon visiting any page of the fake website, obfuscated JavaScript code runs in the victim’s browser. The likely goal of the code is to enable selective targeting by determining sufficient device- and network-specific details about visitors.</p><p>The script performs the following tasks:</p><ul>

</ul><p>In addition to its data collection routines, the fake website contains functionality designed to dynamically alter on-page references to a specific model and replace them with details and images of a model named “Shir Benzion.” We assess that this replacement profile is likely fictitious and part of a social engineering tactic.</p><p>Attackers also inject a link to a private album into the profile for this fictitious model, though it appears to be non-functional at the time of writing. We assess that this is likely a placeholder intended for targeted social engineering attacks, potentially serving as a mechanism for harvesting credentials or delivering malware payloads. We illustrate these observations in Figures 2 and 3.</p><figure id="attachment_140307" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140307" style="width: 891px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-140307 lozad" data-src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/word-image-630264-140284-2.png" alt="Two screenshots comparing the legitimate versus fake modeling agencies.
